# System Explanation

The officially promoted PVE lineup for 4v2, including the Dijeishi system, Hero system, and Huanling Shi system.

## Dijeishi System

The earliest generation of system teams, with a very flexible lineup that can be single or dual DPS, and has multiple exclusive supports, as well as general-purpose supports.

The core of the system is the **Dijeishi**. By having our pets meet certain conditions to collect energy (no need to be on the field), after the energy is **full at 100**, **click the avatar to open the domain (does not take up a turn), giving our entire team a buff and strengthening skills.** Within **4 rounds**, it achieves burst output through **strengthened exclusive skills** and **domain burst skills**. Otherwise, it has almost no output. The domain **can only be opened once per battle**.

The domain needs to consume system enhancement stones to unlock. In addition, each Dijeishi has its own **contract pet**. The Dijeishi can obtain a **10% stat bonus of the contract pet's all attributes** (provided after the contract, if it is in the backpack during battle, regardless of whether it is on the field, the stat bonus is **25%**) and **collects extra energy**.

- In **Domain Advent**, the domain **energy collection is doubled**, the **duration becomes infinite**, and **using the ultimate does not close it.**

### Pangu Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Strong Shield**
- **Domain Energy Acquisition:** When our pet with a **strong shield** is attacked, it gains **15** domain energy. The first time each pet gains energy, it is doubled. The contractor's double energy count +1. An additional **10** domain energy is gained at the end of each round.
- **System DPS Pets: Pangu (Super Earth main DPS), Suisuiqi (field sub-DPS), Isis (field sub-DPS)**
- **System Support Pets: Seraph (self-destruct, general support), Mingwang (constellation, general support)**
- **Changye Xuyuan - Zhulong (non-self-destruct, contractor, dedicated support) Strong Shield, Damage Increase, Power Increase**
- **Upon switching in**, grants **our entire team a strong shield for 2 rounds**; ultimate **dispels 2 debuffs from an ally** and **grants a strong shield for 2 rounds**. When **our entire team has a strong shield**, **damage is increased by 200%**, **inheritable**, **8 rounds**; reduces the enemy's **all-attribute stats by 25% × the number of our pets with a strong shield**, **8 rounds**. Small skill grants an ally **power increase of 37.5%**, **2 rounds**. **Most commonly used in the system**, requires **22,500 normal attack** to **maximize the buff**.
- **Ciyuan Shouhu - Yisaer (non-self-destruct, can be used as a general support) Strong Shield, Damage Increase, Normal Attack Increase**
- **Upon entering the field**, grants **our entire team a 100%/50% increase in damage and normal attack stats when they have a strong shield**, **inheritable**, **8 rounds**. **Each time it hits with its first attack each round**, it deducts the target's HP and converts it into a **strong shield for our entire team**, lasting **2 rounds**. Can be used as a **general normal attack support**/**medium-stat attacker**. Requires **22,500 normal attack** to **maximize the buff**.
- **Faust - Guilingzhe (non-self-destruct, dedicated support) Clear Light Energy, Power Increase**
- **Clears the opposing pet's light energy when switching in**; upon **first departure**, grants the entire enemy team **8 instances of 120% increased power when attacked by a pet with a strong shield, for 9 rounds. Can get a free King exclusive,** generally **used in 6v1 with a main DPS that has a strong shield.**
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** After Pangu opens the domain, it **absorbs 6 levels of all attributes from the entire enemy team**. Pets on the field **with a strong shield have their critical hit rate +100%**, **super-effective multiplier +100%**. **When Pangu itself has a strong shield**, it will **counterattack with its exclusive skill** when attacked. The key to high damage is **counterattacking.**
- **Common System Lineups:**
- **1. Seraph + Suisuiqi + Zhulong + Pangu Dual DPS Lineup**
  :::tip
  Suisuiqi is best with the Ying card, if you don't have it, use the Yin card; Pangu's Dun card is better than the Ying card, if you only have one Ying card, give it to Pangu, otherwise use the Yin card; Zhulong's soul card should stack normal attack.
  :::

- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Seraph self-destructs and switches to Zhulong, Suisuiqi uses Guangjin's second light to get a shield.
- [+60/45/30 Pangu energy: 70/55/40]
- **Round 2:** Zhulong, having received Seraph's light, enters the field and uses its ultimate to grant a shield to the entire team.
- [+45/30/15 Pangu energy: 125/95/65]
- **Round 3:** Zhulong is replaced by Pangu, Suisuiqi uses Guangjin's second light to get a shield.
- [+30/15 Pangu energy: 165/135/90]
- **Round 4:** If Pangu's energy is full, open the domain. If not, use **Diluo** to get a strong shield. Suisui uses **second light** for output.
- After Pangu's domain is opened, use **Tiansheng** to attack. Suisui uses **second light** for output.
- **2. Seraph + Mingwang/132 + Zhulong + Pangu Pangu Single DPS Lineup, suitable for use when Pangu is super-effective against both enemies.**
  :::tip
  **Key Operation:** Zhulong carries the attribute skill **Gengu Lingguang to increase power,** and **uses its ultimate to replenish the shield on the 3rd round** of the domain.
  :::

Pangu and Zhulong are mandatory, the other two positions are optional. For example, Suisui can be replaced with Isis.

- **3. Seraph + Zhulong + Guilingzhe + Mingwang + 132 + Pangu 6v1 Lineup**
- Guilingzhe and 132 can be replaced with other supports as appropriate. Since the configuration is troublesome, it is generally used in fantasy epics.
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Fun to play, many videos available to copy.
- **Cons:** If Zhulong's shield breaks too quickly, energy accumulation will be much slower. High damage requires having a shield and being attacked. In a dual DPS lineup, the counterattack may hit a non-super-effective target. The Yuan card's damage is pathetic, requires paid cards, and is unplayable in Otherworldly. Often faces annoying opponents like God, Zeus, and Gaia, and is easily stopped. **Huanling Pangu** is a better alternative.

  4.1.2 Odin Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Deducting Light Energy**
- **Domain Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **deducts the enemy pet's light energy**, it gains **12** domain energy. The first time each pet gains energy, it is doubled. The contractor's double energy count +1. An additional **10** domain energy is gained at the end of each round.
- **System DPS Pets: Odin (Super God main DPS), Freya (field sub-DPS)**
- **System Support Pets: Empress (self-destruct, general support), Mengpo/Nüdi (self-destruct, general support), Ziya (non-self-destruct, general support), Qiyuan Xihe (non-self-destruct, general support), Linlang (constellation, general support)**
- **Shenguo Shengci zhi Yu - Frigg (non-self-destruct, dedicated support) Damage Increase, Power Increase**
- **Upon first switching out**, grants **our entire team a damage and power increase based on how low their light energy is before attacking, up to 150%/75%, for 8 rounds.** Requires **22,500 special attack** to maximize the buff.
- **Chuangshi Zuicai Longshen - Sagaliya (non-self-destruct, contractor, dedicated support) Attribute Reduction, Debuff, Critical Damage**
- **Upon switching in, deducts 1 light energy from the opposing pet and inflicts 2 instances of 60% increased damage taken for 3 rounds; upon entering the field, reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels;** ultimate debuffs the entire enemy team **(all-attribute stats are reduced by 50%/25%) for 8 rounds; our side's critical damage increases the lower our light energy is before attacking, up to 210%, inheritable, for 8 rounds.** Requires **22,505 special attack** to maximize the buff. Small skill deducts light. After Sagaliya's ultimate, **Odin's second light's damage is increased, but the ultimate's damage is reduced due to a bug**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** After Odin opens the domain, **our entire team's all attributes +6**, **the lower our light energy is before attacking, the higher our critical hit rate and super-effective multiplier, up to 100%**. It can **overdraft light energy** to use skills. During the domain, overdrafting light energy will **additionally consume HP**, requiring support to use HP potions to recover. Damage is achieved through its **low light energy count**. The **second light skill is single-target** output, and the **ten-light ultimate is group** output. In **Domain Advent**, it can use its ultimate continuously.
- **Common System Lineups:** The Odin team generally uses a **single DPS lineup**. If you want to play Freya, just pair her with Empress, Mengpo, and a constellation.
- **1. Linlang + Sagaliya + Mengpo + Odin** Mengpo can be replaced with Empress. The Kuiren card is not as good as the Chen card, not recommended to get.
- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Linlang opens the constellation and switches to Odin, Sagaliya switches to Mengpo, Mengpo's passive deducts light.
- [+24 Odin energy: 34]
- **Round 2:** Mengpo self-destructs and is replaced by Sagaliya, triggering the passive to deduct light. Odin uses Jinggu Yuyan to deduct light. [+48/24 Odin energy: 92/68]
- **Round 3:** Sagaliya uses Fazui zhi Jian to deduct light, Odin uses Jinggu Yuyan to deduct light. [+36/24/12/0 Odin energy: 138/126/114/102/90/78] (Under normal circumstances, the energy is full at the end of the **3rd** round)
- **Round 4:** Odin opens the domain and uses the second light for output, Sagaliya uses its ultimate.
- After that, Odin uses 2 light for output, and the ultimate to finish off. Sagaliya gives Odin medicine.
- **2. Empress/+Nüdi/Mengpo + Odin + Ziya** Low cost, average damage. Ziya stays on the field and uses 2 light to deduct light.
- **3. Empress/Linlang + Frigg + Odin + Sagaliya** Classic lineup, Frigg just needs to be switched out directly.
- **4. Linlang + Qiyuan Xihe + Sagaliya + Odin** A lineup for maximizing damage. Qiyuan Xihe switches to Sagaliya, Sagaliya uses its ultimate and then switches back to Qiyuan Xihe. Qiyuan Xihe's attribute skill gives an extra turn, allowing for two more small skill attacks.
- As long as you have Odin and Sagaliya, the other two are quite flexible. There are few dedicated supports, so you need to bring other damage-increasing pets for 6v1.
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Stable and fast domain energy acquisition, high damage, can deal with groups.
- **Cons:** A bit fragile, can only fight against super-effective god types. Freya with a free King exclusive and the high-stat **Shen Xihe** can be used as replacements. Opponents are often PVE powerhouses like Longmu and Tianming. Sagaliya and Odin both have low PP, making it easy to run out and get stuck. The fixed damage is very painful, and they will be executed by Huanglong's Zhanming when their HP is low.

  4.1.3 Kaos System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Attack Count**
- **Domain Energy Acquisition:** When our pet's **attack count >5** and at least **1** attack hits, it gains **15** domain energy. The first time each pet gains energy is doubled. The contractor's double energy count +1. No domain energy is gained at the end of each round.
- **System DPS Pets:** **Kaos (Super Dark main DPS), Fafnir (most commonly used field sub-DPS)**
- **There are many usable field sub-DPS, as long as the attack count >5, including the new skill set first-generation Xingchen, Guangjin Zhenli zhi Hou, Guangjin Ailin, Guangjin Yelan, Mibao 132, and Xiao Xiongzuo. More new pets may be added in the future.**
- **System Support Pets:** **Empress (self-destruct, general support), Mengpo/Nüdi (self-destruct, general support), Ziya (self-destruct, general support), Linlang (Quehuang, general support)**
- **Shengyu Aigu zhi Hua - Lilith (non-self-destruct, dedicated support) Damage Increase, Critical Damage Increase**
- **Upon first switching out**, grants **our entire team a 150%/75% increase in damage and critical damage for skills with an attack count >5, inheritable, for 8 rounds.** Requires **22,500 special attack** to maximize the buff.
- **Hundun Jijin - Erebos (non-self-destruct, contractor, dedicated support) Attribute Reduction, Debuff, Power Increase**
- **Upon entering the field, reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels;** ultimate debuffs the entire enemy team **(all-attribute stats are reduced by 50%/25%) for 8 rounds, and increases the power of our entire team's skills with an attack count >5, up to 210%, inheritable, for 8 rounds.** Requires **22,505 special attack** to maximize the buff. The **odd-numbered** uses of the small skill are **guaranteed to attack 7 times**, and the **ultimate attacks 6 times**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** After Kaos opens the domain, **our entire team's all attributes +6**, and **the critical hit rate and super-effective multiplier of skills with an attack count >5 are increased by up to 100%**. It relies on **high attack count** for burst output. The small skill is single-target output, and the ultimate can **combo once on the target with the lowest HP percentage**, but it will enter an uncleansable exhaustion state afterwards, reducing subsequent damage. Therefore, it is generally used in the last round of the domain for finishing off.
- **Common System Lineups:**
- **1. Lilith/Quehuang/Ziya/Nüdi/Mengpo/Empress + Fafnir + Erebos + Kaos** Dual DPS
  :::tip
  The **Huan card** is the most suitable for the Kaos system. If you only have one, it is recommended to give it to Fafnir. If you don't have it, it is best to use the Chen card, otherwise Fafnir will be lacking in damage. Kaos with the Sui card generally has enough damage.
  :::

- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Ziya self-destructs and is replaced by Erebos, Fafnir uses the second light.
- [+30 Kaos energy: 30]
- **Round 2:** Erebos uses Qixing Luanpo, Fafnir uses the second light.
- [+45 Kaos energy: 75]
- **Round 3:** Erebos uses its **ultimate**, Fafnir uses the second light.
- [+30 Kaos energy: 105]
- **Round 4:** Erebos is replaced by Kaos, Fafnir uses the second light.
- **Round 5:** Kaos opens the domain for output, Fafnir uses Guangjin.
- Erebos can carry an immortality token. It must use its ultimate, don't let it die. Fafnir can be replaced with any sub-DPS with an attack count >5. If the sub-DPS is a normal attack pet, try not to use Nüdi/Mengpo.
- **2. Empress + Nüdi/Lilith/Mengpo/Quehuang + Erebos + Kaos** Single DPS, energy collection is slower.
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very high damage, many team members, wide super-effective coverage, flexible lineup, very fun.
- **Cons:** Fragile, does not gain domain energy at the end of each round, and starts relatively slowly in a single DPS setup. Currently, there are alternatives like Zhigao Rongyao, so it is no longer a must-have. Single DPS can be replaced by Guangjin Ailin.

  4.1.4 Xinuo Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Xinuo Attack**
- **Domain Energy Acquisition:** Our Xinuo gains **8**/**9** domain energy on its **first attack skill use** each round. The first time each pet gains energy is doubled. The contractor's double energy count +1. An additional **10** domain energy is gained at the end of each round.
- **System DPS Pets:** **Yueliang Xinuo (Super Dark main DPS), Xinuoma (Immortal main DPS), both are Dijeishi.**
- **Huo Xinuo (field sub-DPS), An Xinuo (field sub-DPS), Xiao Xinuo (field sub-DPS)**
- **System Support Pets:** **Taiyang Xinuo (self-destruct, single-target attribute reduction, attribute increase, etc.), Shengling Xinuo (self-destruct, debuff)**
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Both Xinuoma and Yueliang Xinuo collect energy through **Xinuo attacks**, and deal damage with **multi-hit attack skills** during the domain. Xinuoma's ultimate's **overflow damage** can splash to another pet, but it will enter an uncleansable exhaustion state afterwards, reducing subsequent damage. Therefore, it is generally used in the last round of the domain for finishing off.\*\*
- **Yueliang Xinuo's ultimate will close the domain after use, so it is also recommended to use it in the last round.**
- The sub-DPS all **strengthen their exclusive skills 4 times after using their ultimate**, which fits well with the domain. Note that Taiyang Xinuo can only reduce and increase the attribute levels of a **single target**. The **field sub-DPS needs to use its ultimate** to copy the attributes.
- **System Lineup:**
- **1. Taiyang Xinuo + Huo Xinuo/Hei Xinuo/Xiao Xinuo + Shengling Xinuo + Xinuoma/Yueliang Xinuo**
- The skill effects of Xinuo pets require **a backpack count of ≥4** to be at full buff, so the lineup is relatively fixed.
- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Taiyang Xinuo self-destructs and is replaced by Shengling Xinuo, Huo Xinuo uses a small skill or takes medicine.
  :::tip
  **Note:** When attribute protection is needed, Taiyang Xinuo uses a small skill in the first round and self-destructs in the second round.
  :::

- [+36/18 Xinuoma energy: 46/28]
- **Round 2:** Shengling Xinuo self-destructs and is replaced by Xinuoma, Huo Xinuo uses a small skill or takes medicine.
- [+27/18 Xinuoma energy: 83/66]
- **Round 3:** Xinuoma uses a small skill, Huo Xinuo uses its ultimate to copy the debuff to another target.
- [+27/18 Xinuoma energy: 120/94]
- **Round 4:** Xinuoma **opens the domain** and uses a small skill for output, Huo Xinuo uses Liehuo Fenxin to attack.
- **Round 7:** Xinuoma decides whether to continue using small skills or use its ultimate to splash and finish off based on the situation.
  :::tip
  **Note:** The **self-destruct target** of Taiyang Xinuo is generally the target that is **super-effective against Xinuoma** or **not super-effective against the sub-DPS**, so that Huo Xinuo can deal damage while copying the debuff. After Huo Xinuo's revision, its skills can be used freely.
  :::

- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very low cost, stable domain opening, the whole team has free King exclusives, and Xinuoma's domain ultimate's splash effect is very good and widely applicable. **Xinuoma has a final damage bonus against non-super-effective and non-weak targets**; the Xinuo team can also be used in 6v1, which is very suitable for early-game farming of low-stat stages. There are also exclusive buffs during summer and winter vacations.
- **Cons:** Fixed lineup; **no super-effective multiplier, relatively low stats, struggles even with buffs in recent high-difficulty challenges; only reduces the attributes of one pet, high survival pressure on the field sub-DPS.** Yueliang Xinuo has a bug, Xinuo's skills need to deal damage to collect energy, so energy collection is very slow in stages that are immune to non-super-effective damage.

  4.1.5 Lunhui Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Lunhui Bond** pet attack
- **Domain Energy Acquisition:** Our Lunhui Bond pet gains **9** domain energy on its **first attack skill use** each round. The first time each pet gains energy is doubled. The contractor's double energy count +1. An additional **10** domain energy is gained at the end of each round.
- **System DPS Pets:** **Dije Mebius (opens the domain), Guangjin Mebius (main DPS + contractor).**
- **System Support Pets: Empress (self-destruct, general support), Seraph (self-destruct, general support),**
- **Chaoxi Bihuo - Guyuan Lulong (non-self-destruct, dedicated support) Attribute Reduction, Debuff, Damage Increase**
- **Upon entering the field, reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels;** ultimate debuffs the entire enemy team **(all-attribute stats are reduced by 25% × the number of our Lunhui Bond pets, for 8 rounds, and our Lunhui Bond pets' damage is increased, up to 210%/105%, inheritable, for 8 rounds.** Requires **22,050 special attack** to maximize the buff.
- **Yanhuo Yongran - Moyan Jila (non-self-destruct, dedicated support) HP Limit, Critical Damage Increase**
- **Ultimate** increases our **entire team's HP and HP limit by 50%**, **up to 30,000**, and increases the **critical damage of Lunhui Bond pets**, **up to 280%/140%, inheritable, for 8 rounds.** Requires **being on the field for 4 rounds** to maximize the buff.
- **Cangcui Shouwang - Zhongjie Tu (non-self-destruct, dedicated support) Dual Attack Stat Increase**
- Upon entering the field, grants the entire team's **Lunhui Bond pets a dual attack stat increase, up to 50%, inheritable, for 8 rounds.**
- **The actual bonus can be applied to any pet, not commonly used, generally used with Du**, requires **22,500 special attack** to maximize the buff.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Collects energy through the attacks of Lunhui Bond pets. The main damage dealer is Hei Mei, which can stack two blades for one attack. Bai Mei just needs to use its small skill continuously. After using its ultimate, it will enter an uncleansable exhaustion state, reducing subsequent damage. Therefore, it is generally used in the last round of the domain for finishing off.
- **Common System Lineups:**
- **1. Lulong + Jila + Guangjin Mebius + Dije Mebius Classic Lineup**
- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Lulong uses a small skill/takes medicine, Jila uses a small skill/takes medicine.
- [+36/0 Mebius energy: 46/10]
- **Round 2:** Lulong uses a small skill/takes medicine, Jila uses a small skill/takes medicine.
- [+18/0 Mebius energy: 74/20]
- **Round 3:** Lulong uses its ultimate, Jila uses its ultimate.
- [+18 Mebius energy: 102/58]
- **Round 4:** Lulong is replaced by Guangjin Mebi, Jila uses a small skill/takes medicine.
- **Round 5:** Guangjin Mebi takes medicine or uses the second light, Jila is replaced by Dije Mebi.
- **Round 6:** Dije Mebi opens the domain and uses a small skill, Guangjin Mebi uses Guangjin but not the second light.
- **Round 7:** Dije Mebi uses a small skill, Guangjin Mebi uses Guangjin and the second light.
- **2. Empress/Lulong + Seraph + Guangjin Mebius + Dije Mebius** Less pressure on the field, more recommended.
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Basically free, only need to train Guangjin Mebius to be viable. **Can be used in the early game.**
- **Cons:** Bai Mei's stats are average, damage is too low; Lulong and Jila stay on the field for a long time, which puts some pressure; opponents are often super electric "births", with possible thunderstrikes, fast attribute reduction, etc. The traditional Lunhui team has stats that are too low and can no longer pass recent high-difficulty challenges. With high constellation points, you can use **Empress, Huo Tian, constellation, Hei Mei, or find other solutions.**

  4.1.6 Summary

It's not hard to see that the Dijeishi's output idea is still **4 rounds of high burst**, so it's very troublesome to be stopped. As an early system, the **disadvantages are relatively obvious**, and the user experience is not good. **In addition, the exclusive supports of the Dijeishi system basically need to** stack attacks to maximize the bonus, which is more troublesome to configure. Currently, only **Domain Advent** occasionally has special bonuses, but there are generally new solutions. It is basically not the optimal solution for challenges, and is mainly for entertainment and fun. **It is not recommended to cultivate it in the early stage**. If you have already cultivated it or got it from random diamond equipment, you can use it.

- **Cultivation Recommendation:** Xinuo team, Lunhui team > Kaos team > Pangu team, Odin team
- Dije main DPS ≈ field sub-DPS > contract pet > other supports. **Don't play dual DPS without the King exclusive.**

## Hero System

The second-generation system team, the lineup is generally a fixed single DPS. When choosing, just look at the attribute that is super-effective against both bosses. In addition to the exclusive field support, it uses general-purpose self-destruct supports and constellations, and the cost is relatively low.

The core of the system is the **Hero pet (the system is XX Shenyu,** named after the first pet, Wumian's system, Hero Shenyu**).** By having our pets meet certain conditions to collect **50** energy (requires being on the field), after the energy is **full**, it **automatically releases the Mingyun Shenpan** skill **to attack (does not take up a turn)**. Energy collection is fast, generally one Mingyun Shenpan every **2** rounds. **The Mingyun Shenpan skill has high damage, and the small skill and ultimate also have considerable output**. It can effectively deal output before the debuff ends. Compared to the Dijeishi and Guangjin pets, it is more inclined to **sustained output**, and the fault tolerance is relatively high.

- **Mingyun Shenpan** needs to consume system enhancement stones to unlock. In addition, each hero has its own **contract pet**. After the contract, the **Hero pet's all-attribute stats are increased by 50% when fighting against leader-level targets. After the August 1st update,** the **contract pet** does not need to be on the field or **cultivated** for the **all-attribute stat bonus to take effect**. Therefore, **constellation pets** are generally used to provide a **super-effective multiplier. Since the constellation has an additional stat bonus, if the constellation pet has a King exclusive/Otherworldly with a 25% super-effective multiplier, it only needs a small amount of constellation points to be more effective than a field support. Although **this section gives the notes for using the exclusive support, it is more recommended to use the constellation in actual use.\*\*
- Our pet gains **50** energy by **meeting specific conditions**, and can gain energy at most **once per round**; the **same pet** can only gain energy **once every 2 rounds**; **100** energy is required to release one Mingyun Shenpan.
- In **Domain Advent**, the Hero pet's **energy collection is doubled**.
- The Hero system's **lineup is generally fixed**:
- **1. Empress + Nüdi/Mengpo/Seraph + Hero Pet + Contract Pet** Fast start, simple operation.
  :::tip
  **Key Operation:** Be sure to **self-destruct the Empress and then replace her with the Hero pet**, otherwise it will not receive the Empress's bonus. For specific speed tuning details, please refer to each system team. **When the configuration is insufficient, you can use a chain with the soul weapon for dual debuffs**.
  :::

- **2. Nüdi/Mengpo/Seraph + Contract Pet/Constellation + Support Alai/Yeying + Hero Pet** Tankiest build.
  :::tip
  **Key Operation:** Nüdi/Mengpo/Seraph self-destructs and is replaced by the support Alai/Yeying. The latter, having received the full light effect, uses its ultimate and returns to the backpack, switching to the Hero pet. If the order is reversed, the Hero pet will not receive the Shi card's effect. If a constellation pet is used for support, it can only be **constellation switches to Hero pet**. Other orders have certain problems.
  :::

- **3. Empress + Nüdi/Mengpo/Seraph + Constellation Pet + Hero Pet** Highest damage, most recommended.
  :::tip
  **Key Operation:** If Nüdi/Mengpo/Seraph **does not have a chain**/Yuan card, they need to **take medicine until the third round before self-destructing**, waiting for the Empress to self-destruct and switch to the constellation, which then switches to the Hero pet. Self-destructing in the first or second round will result in **not receiving the constellation's effect**. If you **have a chain soul weapon**/Yuan card, since the chain guarantees immortality for one round, you can just self-destruct in the first round. In the second round, the **constellation switching to the Hero pet has a higher priority than the enemy's small skill**. In short, the **chain soul weapon is recommended**, as it can simplify the operation process, reduce the pressure on the field, and allow for dual debuffs. However, be aware of the fixed damage at the end of the round. You can carry a **Yu card** to heal.
  :::

This lineup is a very common pairing for 4v2. The Hero pet **can be replaced with most main DPS**, such as Guangjin pets, Menghuan Diyue, Huanling Shi, etc. The operation is exactly the same.

### Wumian Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Unacted**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **hits an unacted** pet with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** Main DPS **Wumian Super King type special attack**, general support use Empress/Alai and Nüdi/Mengpo.
- Wumian **has a built-in super-effective multiplier increase**, so the **contract pet Yisheng Yishi** does not provide a super-effective multiplier, but **a power blessing, increasing power by 120% when attacking an unacted pet**. Yisheng Yishi is **easier to accumulate energy** than a constellation.
- **Empress/Yisheng Yishi** can also be **replaced** with **Zhongmo de Canxiang - Naiya**. **Upon first use of its ultimate**, it grants our **entire team a 100%**/**50%** critical hit rate and a **280%/140%** critical damage increase when **attacking an unacted pet**, **inheritable**, for **10** rounds. Note that when using Naiya and **constellation Luolan**, it is best to **release the ultimate when the boss uses a small skill** to collect energy.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Wumian's passive grants it the **highest speed stat on the field** upon entering, and it can **act immediately** when switched in. So as long as it's not a small skill hitting a burst skill, it's basically a first move. Yisheng Yishi's support form also has **increased priority for all skills**, making energy collection very easy.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Nüdi + Wumian + Yisheng Yishi as an example (Mengpo's effect is slightly better than Nüdi's)**
  :::tip
  **Note:** In the Wumian system team, you need to ensure that the **Empress's speed is lower than Nüdi's**, so that Wumian's **immediate action** attack receives Nüdi's bonus and Yisheng Yishi's 50% all-attribute bonus while on the field, and Wumian can also increase Yisheng Yishi's attributes. By default, Nüdi's base speed is higher than the Empress's, so you don't need to give Nüdi a speed sub-card.

- **Round 1:** Empress and Nüdi self-destruct. Nüdi self-destructs first and is replaced by 1314. Empress self-destructs second and is replaced by Wumian. Wumian immediately acts once and uses a small skill.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Wumian 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 2:** Wumian uses a small skill, Yisheng Yishi **switches its Xingyue special skill** to the pink support form.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 3:** Wumian uses its ultimate, Yisheng Yishi uses Guangjin's second light.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Wumian 50) System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 4:** Wumian uses a small skill, Yisheng Yishi uses its ultimate.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Yisheng Yishi 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 5:** Wumian uses a small skill, Yisheng Yishi uses Guangjin's second light.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Wumian 50) System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 6:** Wumian uses its ultimate, Yisheng Yishi uses Guangjin's second light.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Yisheng Yishi 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** A wheelchair system. Both Wumian and Yisheng Yishi have ways to increase their own speed, so you can just spam skills and still accumulate energy steadily. **Wumian increases our entire team's all attributes upon entering the field**. Yisheng Yishi is tanky and has low survival pressure. Both Wumian and 1314 have free King exclusives, and are also good on their own. They have a high appearance rate.
- **Cons:** When the stats are relatively high, you may need a constellation to replace 1314. **Mibao Xinglong** is a better alternative. Yizhu Wumian deals more damage in longer rounds.

**4.2.2** Amon Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **HP Percentage**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet hits a target with a **higher HP percentage than itself** with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Amon Super Ancient type special attack**, general support use Empress/Alai and Nüdi/Mengpo.
- **Contract pet Shizhe** increases our **super-effective multiplier by 100%** when attacking a target with a **higher HP percentage than ourselves**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** The main output of the Amon system is **Mingyun Shenpan**, so energy collection is very important. Amon will **retain 1 HP upon entering the field, with the rest of its HP converted into a strong shield**, making energy accumulation relatively stable; Shizhe's small skill will **deduct 50% of its current HP and convert it into a strong shield**. If you **use a constellation, energy collection may be a problem. Pay attention to the constellation attacking a target with a high HP percentage**.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Nüdi + Amon + Shizhe as an example (using Mengpo requires carrying the chair soul weapon to deduct HP at the start of the battle)**
  :::tip
  **Note:** In the Amon system team, you need to ensure that the **Empress's speed is higher than Nüdi's**. **Since Nüdi deducts its own HP upon entering the field, it can accumulate one energy for Amon**. Give the Empress two speed sub-cards or change her talent to increase speed.
  :::

- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Empress and Nüdi self-destruct. Empress self-destructs first and is replaced by Amon. Nüdi self-destructs second and is replaced by Shizhe.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Nüdi 50) System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 2:** Amon uses its ultimate, Shizhe uses a small skill/takes medicine.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Amon 50) System energy remaining: 0]

- **Round 6:** Amon uses a small skill, Shizhe uses its ultimate.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Amon 50) System energy: 0]
  :::tip
  **Note:** Just make sure Shizhe attacks an enemy with a higher HP percentage than itself. Shizhe should pay attention to its HP.
  :::

- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Amon has a free King exclusive and is used frequently.
- **Cons:** Difficult to collect energy in the late game; both Amon and Shizhe are prone to dying. Amon's low HP percentage makes it easy to be executed, and Shizhe is absolutely super-effective against by fairy-type bosses. It is recommended to give Shizhe a defensive soul weapon and soul card and pay attention to killing threatening targets. You can use Qiling Wang against illusion/super king types, Meng against dual fairy types, or Xinglong/third-generation Zhaojun as replacements.

**4.2.3** Yongheng Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Eternal Type**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our **Eternal type pet hits** a target pet with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Abusu Eternal type normal attack**, general support use Empress/Yeying and Seraph.
- **Contract pet Ofeini** increases our **Eternal type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**. Small skill inflicts a one-time **73% increased damage taken for 2 rounds, requires 22,630 normal attack**. It is recommended to bring a soul card with stats that increase normal attack and HP.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** It deals output by collecting energy through the attacks of Eternal type pets, which is very simple and straightforward.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Seraph + Abusu + Ofeini as an example (the speed of Empress and Seraph doesn't matter)**
- **Round 1:** Empress and Seraph self-destruct. Seraph is replaced by Ofeini, Empress is replaced by Long Abusu.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 0/100 System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 2:** Ofeini uses its ultimate, Long Abusu uses a small skill.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Ofeini 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 3:** Ofeini uses a small skill, Long Abusu uses its ultimate.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Long Abusu 50) System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 4:** Ofeini uses a small skill, Long Abusu uses a small skill.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Ofeini 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 5:** Ofeini uses its ultimate, Long Abusu uses its ultimate.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Long Abusu 50) System energy remaining: 0]
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very mindless operation.
- **Cons:** The Eternal type's super-effective coverage is average and it doesn't have a constellation. It struggles against high-stat opponents and may require dual debuffs to pass; Ofeini is prone to dying, so bring a tanky soul card and soul weapon; common opponents are a bunch of powerhouses, including the high fixed damage Qiqi, the debuff-clearing Shuling, the immune to negative effects + Luanhun first-generation Empress, and the Luanhun Rongyao Yinhe. **Generally replaced by Zhigao Rongyao**.

  4.2.4 Xiaoyao System Team

- **Core Gameplay:** **Speed Level**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **hits a target with a lower speed level than itself** with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Xiaoyao Illusion type normal attack**, general support use Empress/Yeying and Seraph.
- **Contract pet Donghuang Taiyi** increases our **Illusion type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Automatically attacks once upon entering the field, small skill **attacks randomly**. Energy collection is a piece of cake.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Seraph + Xiaoyao + Donghuang Taiyi as an example**
  :::tip
  In the Xiaoyao system team, you need to ensure that the **Empress's speed is lower than Seraph's**, so that Xiaoyao's **immediate action** attack receives Seraph's bonus and Donghuang Taiyi's 50% all-attribute bonus while on the field.

  By default, Seraph's base speed is higher than the Empress's, so you don't need to give Seraph a speed sub-card.
  :::

- **Round 1:** Empress and Seraph self-destruct. Seraph is replaced by Donghuang Taiyi, Empress is replaced by Xiaoyao. Xiaoyao automatically attacks.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Xiaoyao 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 2:** Donghuang Taiyi uses its ultimate, Xiaoyao uses a small skill.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Donghuang Taiyi 50) System energy remaining: 0]

- **Round 5:** Donghuang Taiyi uses its ultimate, Xiaoyao uses its ultimate.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Xiaoyao 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Comes with a spirit lock, not afraid of the opponent increasing their attributes.
- **Cons:** Donghuang Taiyi is prone to dying, it is recommended to give it a defensive soul weapon and soul card; Xiaoyao's random attacks are annoying. Has no constellation, when the enemy does not have a super king type pet, it can be replaced with **constellation + Suisuiqi**, or **Zhigao Rongyao**.

  4.2.5 Fantian Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** HP percentage, HP value, **dual DPS**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** Our pet gains **50** energy when its attack skill hits a target with a **lower HP percentage** than itself (Heitian); gains **50** energy when its attack skill hits a target with a **higher HP value** than itself (Baitian);
- **Standard System Pets:** **Dual DPS are the Super Dark type Heitian and the Super Light type Baitian**, **they contract with each other, are special attack pets, and since it is a dual DPS lineup**, they generally use Nüdi and Alai for support.
- **Heitian provides a 50% super-effective multiplier for Super Light type pets, and Baitian provides a 50% super-effective multiplier for Super Dark type pets.**
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Needs to maintain a high **HP percentage to accumulate energy**. Since the dual heavens have **sufficient survivability**, there is no need to worry. The skills come with **Lingyou and dispel buffs**, and the stability is good.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Nüdi + Baitian + Alai + Heitian as an example. When fighting against dual super-effective enemies, you can use Empress, Nüdi, and the dual heavens. The Empress's buff is given to Heitian.**
  :::tip
  **Both dual heavens use their 5-light ultimates (which are burst skills), which deal more damage.** The 6-light combined ultimate is for PVP.
  :::

The energy calculation is an ideal situation, that is, the HP percentage of the dual heavens is always higher than the boss's when they attack.

- **Round 1:** Nüdi self-destructs and is replaced by Alai, Baitian uses a small skill.
- [**Baitian** Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Nüdi 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- **Round 2:** Alai uses its ultimate on Baitian and switches to Heitian, Baitian uses a small skill.

- [**Baitian** Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 (Heitian 50) System energy remaining: 50]
- [**Heitian** Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Heitian 50) System energy remaining: 0]
  :::tip
  **Note:** It's okay if you're confused. Just use the ultimate when it's available. Each one attacks its super-effective target. If both are super-effective, attack the same one. In actual combat, the number of Heitian's Mingyun Shenpan may be less than the ideal value, but the damage is generally enough.
  :::

- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Commonly used in PVP, comes with PP recovery, and is relatively tanky.
- **Cons:** High cultivation cost for dual DPS; easy to miss with Mingyun Shenpan when fighting against separately super-effective targets; have **Huanling Sheng Tianyi and Guangjin Ailin as better alternatives**, not recommended to prioritize cultivating.

  4.2.6 Luoyisi Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Hitting the same target for two consecutive rounds**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** Our pet gains **50** energy by **hitting the same target for two consecutive rounds**.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Luoyisi Super Spacetime type normal attack**, general support use Empress/Yeying and Seraph.
- **Contract pet Heiyi** increases our **Super Spacetime type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Unique energy collection mechanism. Although it is possible to achieve one hero skill every two rounds through operation, it requires both itself and its support to **continuously attack the same target for two consecutive rounds**. Operations such as replenishing PP/activating attributes will delay energy collection. If a constellation is used, the constellation takes medicine for one round and then attacks, staggering the energy collection.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Seraph + Luoyisi + Heiyi as an example. It is more recommended to use a constellation, because Heiyi is too fragile.**

- **Round 1:** Empress self-destructs and is replaced by Luoyisi, **Seraph's Ranshao zhi Jian can start up faster.**
  :::tip
  **Note:** If Seraph self-destructs in the first round, **the Empress must be faster than Seraph**, otherwise Heiyi will grant the Empress immortality, preventing her from self-destructing. Heiyi can activate its attribute in the 2nd round and attack in the 3rd round, staggering its energy collection with Luoyisi.

- **Round 5:** Luoyisi uses a small skill, Heiyi uses Shengling Ji/Guangquan.
- [Mingyun Shenpan x1 (Luoyisi 50) System energy remaining: 0]
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Relatively high damage, can be used in Otherworldly, and Heiyi is very commonly used in PVP.
- **Cons:** Fewer hits, exclusive skill has no defense penetration, output relies on the hero skill, but energy collection requires hitting the same target for two consecutive rounds, which cannot be done mindlessly and has some instability. Heiyi deducts its own HP each round and is prone to dying. Be sure to bring a tanky soul card and soul weapon or use a constellation. In addition, the developers like to arrange stages with very high stats for Luoyisi, and some of its opponents are also "births". Can be replaced by the **Zhigao Rongyao team** in the later stages.

  4.2.7 Qiling Wang Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Attribute Level**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **hits a target with a lower total attribute level than itself** with an attack, it gains **50** energy.

- **Contract pet Caesar** increases our **Super Electric type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Qiling Wang has a lot of 4v2 bonuses, and its damage is extremely terrifying. Energy collection is a piece of cake.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Seraph + Xiaoyao + Donghuang Taiyi as an example**
  :::tip
  **Note:** In the Qiling Wang system team, it is recommended that the **Empress's speed is higher than Seraph's**. Seraph and the Empress self-destructing on the same target can accumulate one energy for Qiling Wang. Give the Empress two speed sub-cards or change her talent to increase speed.

- **Pros:** The hero with the highest stats, mindless operation, wide super-effective coverage, high appearance rate, simple challenges, can be used in Otherworldly, and can even beat some single-super-effective stages. Its appearance rate in PVP has also been good recently.
- **Cons:** Caesar is prone to dying; its current uses can basically be replaced by **Lucifer**. Cultivating one in the early game is enough.

  4.2.8 Xihe Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** Consecutive presence
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **hits a target that has been on the field for 2 or more consecutive rounds** with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Xihe Super God type special attack**, general support use Empress/Alai and Nüdi/Mengpo.
- **Contract pet Luoxi** increases our **Super God type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**.

- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Nüdi + Xihe + Luoxi as an example. Nüdi can be replaced with Mengpo.**
  :::tip
  **Note:** In the Xihe system team, you need to ensure that the **Empress's speed is lower than Nüdi's**, so that Luoxi can copy the attributes increased by the Empress and Xihe, thus increasing its survivability.

Its PVP ability is also good. Luoxi's challenges have requirements for cultivation, but you can borrow pets.
- **Cons:** Most of its current uses can be replaced by **Freya with a free King exclusive**.

  4.2.9 Buxiu Long Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Dual Defense Level**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **hits a target with a lower total dual defense level than itself** with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Buxiu Long Immortal type normal attack**, general support use Empress/Yeying and Seraph.
- **Contract pet Kuanglong** increases our **Immortal type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Buxiu Long has a unique reverse pulse mechanism. Its HP limit is doubled, taking damage increases its HP, and receiving healing reduces its HP, with a minimum of 1 HP. It will die immediately when its HP is full. Energy collection is a piece of cake.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **Taking Empress + Seraph + Buxiu Long + Kuanglong as an example**
  :::tip
  **Note:** In the Buxiu Long system team, it is recommended that the **Empress's speed is higher than Seraph's**. Seraph and the Empress self-destructing on the same target can accumulate one energy for Buxiu Long. Give the Empress two speed sub-cards or change her talent to increase speed.

  4.2.10 Tianshi Wang Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Special Attack Level**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet **hits a target with a lower special attack level than itself** with an attack, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Main DPS Tianshi Wang Super Flying type special attack**, general support use Empress/Alai and Nüdi/Mengpo.
- **Contract pet KK** increases our **Super Flying type pets' super-effective multiplier by 100%**.

- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very high damage, mindless operation, hits the entire field, and has very high defense penetration. KK has a free King exclusive, and Tianshi Wang can be used in Otherworldly. KK's entry clears the opposing pet's buffs, which can be used against bosses with special buffs like Longmu. Can be used in PVP.
- **Cons:** KK is prone to dying; Tianshi Wang and the divine weapon Qinghuadu's challenges have a certain degree of difficulty; its super-effective coverage is relatively average.

  4.2.11 Sixth Generation He (Counterattack Hero)

- **Core Gameplay:** **Counterattack + Dual Attack Level**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** When our pet's **counterattack skill hits a target with a lower total dual attack level than itself**, it gains **50** energy.
- **Standard System Pets:** **Jieli Senluo zhi Tong - He'ermes, or Sixth Generation He for short, is a Super Mystic normal attack counterattack pet.** The best supports are Seraph and **Suisuiqi**, followed by Empress/Yeying, and Seraph.
- **Since it collects energy through counterattacks, neither the contract pet Xujin Shenlin zhi Shi - He'ermes nor the constellation can help collect energy. Therefore, it is recommended to use the counterattack system's Xinghuan Shi Nuwa, which provides a super-effective multiplier and helps collect energy.**
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** When any of our pets is hit by a non-counterattack damage for the first time, the Sixth Generation He will use its **exclusive skill to counterattack the opposing pet.** The exclusive skill only buffs the skill triggered by the counterattack. The hero skill's power and damage increase are also low. **The hero skill causes the next counterattack to trigger 2 additional times**. The main source of damage is the **counterattack**.
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **The common lineup is Suisuiqi + Seraph + Sixth Generation He + Xinghuan Nuwa Dual DPS Lineup.**
  :::tip
  **Note:** Suisuiqi's all-attribute level increase can only be given to the **pet on the field and the next pet to enter the field, and is not inheritable. Seraph needs to self-destruct first.** Since their base stats are the same, you can change Seraph's talent to speed or give it a sub-card.
  :::

- **In-battle Operations:** It doesn't matter who is replaced by whom. Pay attention to being **in the correct position with the super-effective pet**.
- **Round 1:** Suisuiqi and Seraph self-destruct, Sixth Generation He and Xinghuan Nuwa enter the field.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 System energy remaining: 50]

- **Round 5:** Sixth Generation He uses a small skill, Nuwa uses its ultimate.
- [Mingyun Shenpan 50/100 System energy remaining: 50]
- **Suisuiqi + Seraph + Constellation + Sixth Generation He Single DPS Lineup, suitable for Super Mystic dual super-effective.**
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Uses Xinghuan Shi to provide a super-effective multiplier, simple operation, can be used in Otherworldly, and can also be used in PVP.
- **Cons:** The stats and damage are actually on the low side among heroes, with few bonuses. The challenges are not easy, and the universal acquisition period is long.

  4.2.12 Summary

The hero's output idea is more inclined to **long-term combat**, which is more durable and stable, and the operation is very simple. Most of them are easy to obtain, and the cultivation cost is also low. Since it is a single DPS lineup, it can also be replaced by Guangjin in some cases. In addition, some can also be replaced by the Zhigao Rongyao system. However, with the launch of the Huanling Shi system, the PVE stats have been significantly inflated, so some of the old system teams with lower stats are no longer recommended for priority cultivation. The systems after Qiling Wang have higher stats and can even be used in Otherworldly, so they are still recommended for cultivation.

- **Cultivation Recommendation:** Wumian team, Amon team, Qiling Wang team > Tianshi Wang team, Xihe team, Buxiu Long team > Others

## Zhigao Rongyao System

- **The Zhigao Rongyao system includes pets with the Zhigao Rongyao system**, currently including **Fenghuang, Yinhe, Alai, Abusu, Longmu, and Xihe**, with more possibly to be released in the future.
  The Zhigao Rongyao system **is very simple to play**. Each member can use the **system skill Zhigao Blessing to self-destruct**, or use **exclusive skills and ultimates for output**. After obtaining a pet, you can **consume 50 system enhancement stones to light up the system. All Zhigao Rongyao pets will then have the corresponding effect added when they self-destruct (regardless of who specifically self-destructs). As long as the contract is made, the self-destruct will have the effect, no need for Otherworldly/King exclusive. Therefore, two sets of King exclusives can be used temporarily.**

- **Fenghuang: Reduces a single enemy's all attributes by 6 levels and their all-attribute stats by 50%/25% for 10 rounds.**
- **Yinhe: Increases the next Zhigao Rongyao pet to enter the field's all attributes by 6 levels and their critical hit rate by 100%/50%, inheritable, for 10 rounds.**
- **Alai: Increases the power of Zhigao Rongyao pets by 150%/75%, inheritable, for 10 rounds.**
- **Abusu: Increases the damage of Zhigao Rongyao pets by 200%/150%, inheritable, for 10 rounds.**
- **Longmu: Increases the numerical value and upper limit of the power increase and damage increase effects in Zhigao Blessing by 30%.**
- **Xihe: The next Zhigao Rongyao pet to enter the field absorbs 5 levels of a random attribute on its first attack each round, inheritable, for 10 rounds; all-attribute stats are increased, the effect depends on whether the next pet to enter the field is wearing an Otherworldly or King exclusive. If it is a King exclusive, the increase is 40%/20%, if it is an Otherworldly, the increase is 30%/15%.**
  :::tip
  **Note: The damage increase in Zhigao Blessing and skills requires the number of Zhigao Rongyao pets in the backpack to be 4 to take effect.**
  :::

- **Lineup: Any two for self-destruct + attacker 1 + attacker 2. Remember to give the self-destructing ones a Shi card.**
- Remember to **self-destruct on different targets**. The operation is very simple, anyone can do it.
- **Attacker 1 and Attacker 2 can be the same pet,** commonly known as **clones**, which is the essence of the Zhigao Rongyao system. Clones deal very high damage. For example, the damage of two Alai (Illusion) is higher than the Xiaoyao team, and the damage of two Abusu (Eternal) is higher than the Yongheng team. So in fact, 12 pets are the complete form of the Zhigao Rongyao system.
  If you don't have clones but still want to **single DPS**, for example, using one Longmu to fight two super spacetime types, you can **self-destruct one first** to let the main DPS enter the field, and the other **bring a tanky build** and rely on small skills to absorb attributes and **stay on the field**. After killing one, switch it out. In the next round, self-destruct any one and switch in the main DPS to refresh the buff's duration. This may not work when the opponent's output is high.

- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very high damage, mindless operation, many usable scenarios after getting clones; recently promoted by the developers, with possible future enhancements. Relatively easy to obtain, with occasional free King exclusives from events.
- **Cons:** Fragile, very easy to die; basically requires King exclusives, high cultivation cost.
- **Cultivation Suggestion: (Represents only my personal and some group members' opinions)**
  Although the Zhigao Rongyao system is constantly being strengthened and is being promoted by the developers, it is still **not recommended to cultivate it in the early game**. It is basically useless when starting out, and there are generally other solutions. In short, you should at least finish cultivating **Huanling Shi, commonly used heroes, and Guangjin** first. **You can slowly collect them through various self-selection activities**. The experience with Otherworldly Zhigao Rongyao is very poor. **You must at least ensure that the two attackers have King exclusives first**. Clones can use Otherworldly for now.

:::tip
**Recommended Cultivation Order: Longmu > Alai > Abusu > Xihe > Fenghuang > Yinhe (Represents only my personal recommendation)**

## Huanling Shi System

The latest generation of system teams, with a lineup composition that is relatively close to the Dijeishi, can be single or dual DPS, and has exclusive supports, as well as general-purpose supports. The design is a bit like a combination of the Dijeishi and the Hero.

The core of the system is the **Huanling Shi**. After clicking the system to **summon the Huanling (does not take up a turn)**, our pets collect energy by meeting certain conditions **(requires being on the field)**. After the energy is **full at 100**, **click to use the Huanling skill (burst skill priority, takes up a turn), to achieve a single round of high burst. The Huanling system's energy collection is very slow, but since the main DPS has high stats, the output of the small skill and ultimate is also very high**. Sometimes the battle can be ended before the Huanling skill is used.

The Huanling Shi system is currently a bit chaotic. The system description says it requires **200 system enhancement stones to unlock**, but Pangu's can be opened by just refreshing. The Huanling Shi **does not have a fixed contract pet**, but each Huanling Shi will have an **exclusive sub-DPS Xinghuan Shi**, which serves as a sub-DPS to supplement output while **providing a super-effective multiplier and high bonuses** and helping to collect energy. In addition, the system has an exclusive self-destruct pet, which can be replaced by a general-purpose support.

- **Xinghuan Shi** can **open the star ring (takes up a turn)** by clicking the system, **providing a buff to our entire team, which requires the Xinghuan Shi to be on the field and closes when it leaves**. The star ring system requires **200 system enhancement stones, 25,000 normal/special attack**, and the **Xinghuan Shi pet to wear a King exclusive, and the stars in the system must be lit to maximize the bonus. The Xinghuan Shi pet has two versions of its body, sharing one set of King exclusive. The cultivation is preserved after the coronation evolution, with only a small difference in stats.**
- In **Domain Advent**, the Huanling Shi's **energy collection is doubled**.

### Xinuoma Team System

- **Core Gameplay:** **Xinuo pet, combo**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** Our **Xinuo pet** gains **4 energy each time it hits with an attack, doubled in multi-pet mode.**
- **Standard System Pets:** Main DPS **Xinuoma Life type special attack**, general support use Empress/Alai and Nüdi/Mengpo.
- The system **has no other members**, and is generally used with **constellation Huayingji or with Xinuo pets**.
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** Xinuoma's **Life type skill will combo 2 times after hitting. It can accumulate 12 energy on its own each round. The Huanling skill deals almost max damage per hit but has few hits, and the small skill and ultimate also have low damage.** It has a **high 4v2 bonus, terrifying damage,** and also has a **50% final damage bonus against non-super-effective and non-weak pets**.
- **Common System Lineups: Xinuoma has high built-in critical damage, Nüdi is better than Mengpo.**
- **1. Empress + Nüdi + Huayingji + Huanling Xinuoma Single DPS Lineup, high damage**
- **2. Nüdi + Huanling Xinuoma + Alai + Dije Xinuoma Dual DPS Lineup, relatively stable survival, fast energy collection**
- **3. Taiyang Xinuo + Hei Xinuo + Shengling Xinuo + Huanling Xinuoma Dual DPS Lineup, can also rely solely on Huanling Xinuoma as the main DPS. Hei Xinuo's built-in combo can help Huanling Xinuoma collect energy. Fast to form, low cost, highly recommended to borrow a Huanling Xinuoma when starting out, and use this lineup to sweep through most of the low-stat stages that allow borrowing pets.**
- **4. Used with a combo team, for example, Wangpai + Houzi + Xinuoma + Sheng Tianyi/Xinghuan Nühuang**
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very high damage, mindless operation, also deals high damage against non-super-effective and non-weak targets, can sweep through most old challenges. Low cultivation cost, can be used in Otherworldly (but energy collection is unstable).
- **Cons: Difficult to obtain**, challenges have high requirements for systems and constellations and do not allow borrowing pets. Although there is an easy way to obtain it, it requires signing in for 10 days.

### Sheng Tianyi Team System (Combo System)

- **Core Gameplay:** **Combo**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** Our **pet** gains **5 energy each time its combo skill hits**.
- **Standard System Pets:** Main DPS **Sheng Tianyi Super Light normal attack**, general support use Empress/Yeying and Seraph.
- **Sub-DPS Xinghuan Shi Nühuang Super Water normal attack**, **Xueyu Shengzhu - Bingxue Nühuang is the post-coronation version**. **Star Ring Skill** causes **our entire team's pets' combo skills** to **combo an additional time with their exclusive skill (each pet is calculated separately) after hitting 6 times; non-combo skills' super-effective multiplier is reduced by 75%, combo skills' super-effective multiplier is increased by 100%/125%, and critical damage is increased by 125%/150% (red is the post-coronation version, all are maxed out system effects).**
  :::tip
  **Note: The additional combo of the exclusive skill will not trigger combo effects and does not count towards the 6 hits. The first skill hit does not count as a combo and does not receive combo-related bonuses. Subsequent combos do.**
  :::

- **Zhongji Wangzhe - Wangpai Zhandui (self-destruct, dedicated support) Attribute Reduction, Debuff, Damage Increase**
- **Immediately fills light energy upon entering the field. Ultimate reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels, and their all-attribute stats by 50%/25% for 10 rounds, and increases our entire team's combo skill damage by 300%/175%, inheritable, for 10 rounds. The next pet gains an additional 3 light energy.**
- **Wudao Chengfo - Sun Wukong (self-destruct, dedicated support) Attribute Increase, Critical Hit Blessing, Power Blessing**
- **Immediately fills light energy upon entering the field. Ultimate increases our entire team's all attributes by 6 levels, increases all skills' critical hit rate by 100%/50%, and increases combo skills' power by 250%/125%, inheritable, for 10 rounds.**
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** **Huanling Sheng Tianyi** has **very high defense penetration, power, and critical damage. Its exclusive skill and ultimate can combo 2 times, and the Qiangguang Lianda in its skill replacement can combo 3 times, so using Qiangguang Lianda collects energy faster. The Huanling skill can unconditionally combo 8 times in PVE, with terrifying damage. Sheng Tianyi has an immediate action upon entering the field, and Nühuang's 1 light also has 2 combos, which, combined with the star ring's additional combo, makes energy collection very fast.**
- **Standard System Lineup:**
- **1. Wangpai + Houzi + Sheng Tianyi + Xinghuan Nühuang Dual DPS Lineup, highest damage lineup, but also the most expensive.**
  :::tip
  **Note:** Houzi's all-attribute level increase can only be given to the **pet on the field and the next pet to enter the field, and is not inheritable. Wangpai needs to self-destruct before Houzi.** But since Houzi **has its own all attributes, and Wangpai gives Houzi a speed boost, Houzi needs to carry the Qihou de Jueze soul weapon to lower its speed. It generally doesn't matter who self-destructs and is replaced by whom.**
  :::

:::tip
**You can also change the starting lineup: Wangpai + Xinghuan Nühuang + Houzi + Sheng Tianyi. No need to worry about speed tuning, more recommended.**
:::

- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Wangpai self-destructs and is replaced by Houzi, Xinghuan Nühuang opens the star ring.
- [Energy +0 System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 2:** Houzi self-destructs and is replaced by Sheng Tianyi, Xinghuan Nühuang uses **1 light**, Sheng Tianyi immediately acts, **opens the Huanling** and uses **Qiangguang Lianda**.
- [Energy +25 (Nühuang 10, Sheng Tianyi 15) System energy remaining: 25]
- **Round 3:** Sheng Tianyi uses Qiangguang Lianda to trigger the star ring effect and combo, Xinghuan Nühuang uses 1 light.
- [Energy +30 (Nühuang 10, Sheng Tianyi 20) System energy remaining: 55]
- **Round 4:** Sheng Tianyi uses Qiangguang Lianda, Xinghuan Nühuang uses 1 light to trigger the star ring effect and combo.
- [Energy +30 (Nühuang 15, Sheng Tianyi 15) System energy remaining: 85]
- **Round 5:** Sheng Tianyi uses Qiangguang Lianda, Xinghuan Nühuang uses 1 light.
- [Energy +25 (Nühuang 10, Sheng Tianyi 15) System energy remaining: 100]
- **Round 6:** Sheng Tianyi uses the Huanling skill to trigger the star ring effect and combo, Xinghuan Nühuang uses 1 light.
- [Energy +10 (Nühuang 10) System energy remaining: 0]
  :::tip
  **Note: Xinghuan Nühuang only needs to use 1 light, because its ultimate does not have a combo.**
  :::

- **2. Seraph + Xinghuan Nühuang + Yeying + Sheng Tianyi Dual DPS Lineup, a low-cost version of lineup 1, with about 60% of the damage.**
- **3. Empress + Seraph + Xinghuan Nühuang + Sheng Tianyi Single DPS Lineup, Xinghuan Nühuang only plays a supporting role, Sheng Tianyi receives the Empress's buff. Under the same conditions, the damage is not as good as lineup 1 but better than lineups 2 and 3.**
- **4. Empress + Seraph + Constellation + Sheng Tianyi Single DPS Lineup, lowest cost.**
- **The main DPS can also be Huanling Xinuoma. When the combo count is ≥2, the benefit of Xinghuan Nühuang will be greater than that of the constellation. Therefore, pets with only one combo, such as Guangjin Suisuiqi, are not recommended. However, in some special cases, you can use pets with fewer combos, such as Yizhu Wumian/Abisi, to form a dual DPS with Xinghuan Nühuang. This is generally for super-effective coverage. Heroes like Amon King and Buxiu Long, whose skills have combos but whose main source of damage is the hero skill, which does not have a combo, are not recommended for the combo lineup.**
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very, very high damage, many hits, mindless operation, can sweep through most old challenges. A recently promoted lineup, the main DPS Sheng Tianyi is easy to obtain, has a low cultivation cost, can be used in Otherworldly, and is very strong in PVP.
- **Cons:** A bit fragile, combos are considered multiple actions, so it is easy to have its attributes reduced by Qiling Wang, and take a lot of damage from Belial/Fenghuang's burn. The stages customized for Sheng Tianyi by the developers generally have high stats and are difficult to replace. Xinghuan Nühuang's coronation challenge is relatively difficult, with certain requirements for both system teams and constellations, and does not allow borrowing pets.

### Pangu Team System (Counterattack System)

- **Core Gameplay:** **Counterattack**
- **System Energy Acquisition:** Our **pet gains 10 energy on its first counterattack skill hit** each round.
- **Standard System Pets:** Main DPS **Pangu Super Earth normal attack**, general support use Empress/Yeying and Seraph.
- In addition, the **main DPS can also be Guangjin Zhaojun (Super Ancient) or Hero Sixth Generation He (see 4.2.11).**
- **Sub-DPS Xinghuan Shi Nuwa Fairy Spirit normal attack**, **Zaohua zhi Zu Shen - Nuwa is the post-coronation version**. **Star Ring Skill** causes **our entire team's non-counterattack skills' super-effective multiplier to be reduced by 75%, and counterattack skills' super-effective multiplier to be increased by 100%/120%, and damage to be increased by 100%/120% (red is the post-coronation version, all are maxed out system effects).**
- **Shanhe Xirang - Suisuiqi (self-destruct, dedicated support) Attribute Increase, Critical Hit Blessing, Power Blessing**
- **Gains 6 light energy upon entering the field. Ultimate increases our entire team's all attributes by 6 levels, increases all skills' critical hit rate by 100%/50%, and increases counterattack skills' power by 250%/125%, inheritable, for 10 rounds.**
- **System Main DPS Analysis:** **Pangu's first attack each round inflicts the Tiandi mark on the target for 2 rounds. Each round, when any of our pets is hit for the first time, it will use its exclusive skill to counterattack the pet with the mark. There can only be one mark on the field at a time. Attacking a target B without a mark will cause the mark on the target A with a mark to disappear. The mark can be used to ensure that the counterattack hits a super-effective target each round. In addition, Pangu's stats are very high, and its non-counterattack skills also have a certain amount of damage. The Huanling skill will force the opponent to attack itself and counterattack with the Huanling skill, with a high total number of hits and damage.**
- **System Operation Explanation:**
- **The common lineup is Suisuiqi + Seraph + Sixth Generation He + Xinghuan Nuwa Dual DPS Lineup.**
  :::tip
  **Note:** Suisuiqi's all-attribute level increase can only be given to the **pet on the field and the next pet to enter the field, and is not inheritable. Seraph needs to self-destruct first.** Since their base stats are the same, you can change Seraph's talent to speed or give it a sub-card.
  :::

- **In-battle Operations:** **It is recommended to have Seraph self-destruct and be replaced by Pangu**. Pangu can use its ultimate to get a first move and apply the mark, ensuring a counterattack in the second round. Note that **Nuwa prioritizes counterattacking the opposing pet, so it needs to be in the correct position with the super-effective pet**.
- **In-battle Operations:**
- **Round 1:** Seraph self-destructs and is replaced by Pangu, Suisui self-destructs and is replaced by Xinghuan Nuwa.
- [Energy +0 System energy remaining: 0]
- **Round 2:** Pangu activates Huanling and uses its ultimate, Nuwa opens the star ring.
- [Energy +20 (Pangu 10, Nuwa 10) System energy remaining: 20]
- **Round 3:** Pangu uses a small skill, Nuwa uses its ultimate.
- [Energy +20 (Pangu 10, Nuwa 10) System energy remaining: 40]
- **Round 4:** Pangu uses its ultimate, Nuwa uses a small skill.
- [Energy +20 (Pangu 10, Nuwa 10) System energy remaining: 60]
- **Round 5:** Pangu uses a small skill, Nuwa uses its ultimate.
- [Energy +20 (Pangu 10, Nuwa 10) System energy remaining: 80]
- **Round 6:** Pangu uses a small skill, Nuwa uses a small skill.
- [Energy +20 (Pangu 10, Nuwa 10) System energy remaining: 100]
- **Round 6:** Pangu uses the Huanling skill, Nuwa uses a small skill.
- [Energy +20 (Pangu 10, Nuwa 10) System energy remaining: 20]
- **2. Seraph + Xinghuan Nuwa + Yeying + Pangu Dual DPS Lineup, a low-cost version of lineup 1, with about 60% of the damage.**
- **3. Empress + Seraph + Constellation + Pangu Single DPS Lineup, lowest cost. Since Nuwa provides few bonuses, Nuwa is generally not used when Pangu is the single DPS.**
- **System Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:** Very high damage, many hits, mindless operation, can sweep through most old challenges. A recently promoted lineup, Pangu's challenges and Nuwa's coronation challenge are not difficult. Suisui has a free King exclusive, and Nuwa has a free Otherworldly full battle, so the cost is relatively low. One Xinghuan Shi can be paired with three outputs, making the lineup quite flexible.
- **Cons:** Recent challenges have a high demand for **Nuwa's King exclusive**, while Pangu can be used with Otherworldly for now. The stages customized by the developers generally have high stats and are difficult to replace. Still a bit afraid of bosses with strong control and attribute reduction.

  4.2.4 Summary

Huanling Shi should have many more releases in the future. There are only three for now, so I'll give a simple conclusion: their stats are very high, they can sweep through old challenges, and the developers customize the environment for them almost every week in challenges. It is highly recommended to cultivate them.

- **Cultivation Recommendation: Sheng Tianyi team, Pangu team** > Xinuoma team
- **Xinghuan Shi King exclusive > Huanling Shi King exclusive** > Self-destruct dedicated support King exclusive (has lower-tier replacements)

## Comprehensive Cultivation Recommendation

- **(Represents only the writer's personal recommendation) The free Xinuo team, Amon team, and Wumian team are not included in the comparison. The Lunhui team only requires cultivating one Hei Mei, and Hei Mei is almost a must-have for starting out, so it is also not included in the comparison.**
