# System Explanation

The official 4v2 recommended PVE lineup, including Boundary Master system, Hero system, and Summoner system.

## Boundary Master System

The earliest generation system team, lineup is very flexible, can be single C or double C, has multiple exclusive assists, can also use universal assists.

System core is **Boundary Master**, through our pets meeting certain conditions to collect energy (no need to be on field), energy **full 100** then **click avatar to open realm (no turn cost), give our full field buff and strengthen skills,** within **4 rounds** through **strengthened exclusive skills** and **realm burst skills** achieve burst output, otherwise almost no output. Realm **can only be opened once per battle**.

Realm needs to consume system strengthening stones to unlock, in addition each Boundary Master has their own **contract pet**, Boundary Master can gain **contract pet all stats 10%** value bonus (provided after contract, if in backpack during battle, regardless of on field, value bonus is **25%**) and **additional energy collection**.

- **Realm Descent** realm **energy collection doubled**, **duration rounds become infinite** and **using big move doesn't close.**

### Pan Gu Team System

- **System play core**: **Effective Shield**
- **Realm energy acquisition**: Our pets with **effective shield** when attacked gain **15** realm energy points, each pet **first acquisition energy doubled**, contractor doubled times +1, extra **10** realm energy points at end of each round.
- **System output pets: Pan Gu (Super Earth main C), Su Sui Qi (fielding vice C), Isis (fielding vice C)**
- **System assist pets: Burning Angel (self-destruct, universal assist), Ming Wang (Starry, universal assist)**
- **Eternal Night Abyss - Zhu Long (non-self-destruct, contractor, exclusive assist) Effective shield, damage increase, power increase**
- **Fielding replacement** grants **our full field effective shield 2** rounds; big move **dispels 2 ally debuffs** and **grants effective shield 2** rounds, **our full field has effective shield** when **damage increase 200%**, **inheritible**, **8** rounds. Small skill grants ally **power increase 37.5%**, **2** rounds. **Most commonly used system**, needs **22500 normal attack** to **maximize buff**.
- **Dimension Guardian - Isar (non-self-destruct, can be universal assist) Effective shield, damage increase, normal attack increase**
- **Fielding** grants **our full field has effective shield** when **damage and normal attack stat increase 100%/50%**, **inheritible**, **8** rounds. **Own each round first attack** deducts target HP to convert to **our full field effective shield**, lasts **2** rounds. Can be **normal attack universal assist**/**medium stat attacker**. Needs **22500 normal attack** to **maximize buff**.
- **Faust - Zero (non-self-destruct, exclusive assist) Clear light energy, power increase**
- **When fielding replacement** clear opponent light energy; first **leaving field** grants enemy full field **8** times when attacked by **pets with effective shield** **power increase 120%, 9 rounds. Can free King exclusive, **generally** used for 6v1 with effective shield main C.**
- **System main C analysis**: Pan Gu after opening realm **drains enemy full field 6 level all stats**, on field pets **holding effective shield crit rate +100%**, **restraint multiplier +100%**, **Pan Gu own has effective shield when** attacked will perform one **exclusive skill counterattack,** high damage key is **counterattack.**
- **System commonly used lineups**:
- **1. Burning Angel + Su Sui Qi + Zhu Long + Pan Gu double C lineup**
  :::tip
  Su Sui Qi best with Response Card, if not then Song Card; Pan Gu shield card effect better than Response Card, if only one Response Card prioritize Pan Gu, if not then Song Card; Zhu Long soul cards stack normal attack.
  :::

- **In-battle operations:**
- Round **1**: Burning Angel self-destruct switch Zhu Long, Su Sui Qi Light Ember two lights gain shield
- [+60/45/30 Pan Gu energy:70/55/40]
- Round **2**: Zhu Long eats Burning Angel's light fielding open big grant full field shield
- [+45/30/15 Pan Gu energy:125/95/65]
- Round **3**: Zhu Long replace Pan Gu, Su Sui Qi Light Ember two lights gain shield
- [+30/15 Pan Gu energy:165/135/90]
- Round **4**: Pan Gu energy full open realm, if not full use **Earth Fall** gain effective shield, Su Sui use **two lights** for output
- Pan Gu realm opened use **Heaven Ascend** for attack, Su Sui use **two lights** for output
- **2. Burning Angel + Ming Wang/132 + Zhu Long + Pan Gu Pan Gu single C lineup suitable for double restraint by Pan Gu**
  :::tip
  **Operation points:** Zhu Long carries attribute skill **Eternal Spirit Light power increase,** Boundary round **3** **open big supplement shield**.
  :::

Pan Gu and Zhu Long must, other two positions optional, e.g. Su Sui can change to Isis.

- **3. Burning Angel + Zhu Long + Zero + Ming Wang + 132 + Pan Gu 6v1 lineup**
- Zero and 132 can be replaced with other assists as appropriate, due to configuration trouble, generally for Fantasy Epic.
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Entertainment effect quite good, many people like to play, have many ready-made videos to copy.
- **Disadvantages** If Zhu Long shield breaks too fast energy accumulation slow. High damage needs to have shield and take hits, double C lineup may counterattack non-restrained targets. Circle card damage pitiful, needs paid cards, Otherworld even more unplayable. Often face god, Zeus, Gaia these stupid things, easy to be stopped action. **Summoner Pan Gu** is upper tier.

  4.1.2 Odin Team System

- **System play core**: **Deduct light energy**
- **Realm energy acquisition**: Our pets **deduct enemy pet light energy** gain **12** realm energy points, each pet **first acquisition energy doubled**, contractor doubled times +1, extra **10** realm energy points at end of each round.
- **System output pets: Odin (Super God main C), Freya (fielding vice C)**
- **System assist pets: Empress (self-destruct, universal assist), Meng Po/Empress (self-destruct, universal assist), Zi Ya (non-self-destruct, universal assist), Yuan Xihe (non-self-destruct, universal assist), Lin Lang (Starry, universal assist)**
- **God Realm Blessing Feather - Freya (non-self-destruct, exclusive assist) Damage increase, power increase**
- **First replacement off field** grants **our full field light energy lower damage and power increase higher, max increase 150%/75%, 8 rounds.** Needs **22500 special attack** to maximize buff.
- **Creation Sin Judgment Dragon God - Sarahlia (non-self-destruct, contractor, exclusive assist) Attribute reduction, weaken, crit damage**
- **Fielding deduct opponent pet 1 light energy, grant 2 times 60% easy damage 3 rounds; fielding weaken enemy full field all attributes 6 levels; big move enemy full field weaken (all attribute values lower 50%/25%) 8 rounds; our light energy lower crit damage higher, max 210%, inheritible, 8 rounds.** Needs **22505 special attack** to maximize buff. Sara open big after **Odin two lights damage increase, big move due to bug damage decrease**.
- **System main C analysis**: Odin after opening realm **our full field all attributes +6**, **light energy lower crit rate and restraint multiplier higher, max 100%**. Rely on **low light energy count** for burst output. **Two lights skill single target** output, **ten lights big move group output**. **Realm Descent** can always big move.
- **System commonly used lineups**: Odin team generally single C, want to play Freya pair Empress Meng Po Starry ok
- **1. Lin Lang + Sarahlia + Meng Po + Odin Meng Po replaceable with Empress, puppet card effect not as good as Dust Card, not recommended supplement**
- **In-battle operations:**
- Round **1**: Lin Lang open Starry replace Odin, Sarahlia replace Meng Po, Meng Po passive deduct light
- [+24 Odin energy:34]
- Round **2**: Meng Po self-destruct replace Sarahlia trigger passive deduct light, Odin use Restraint Prophecy deduct light [+48/24 Odin energy:92/68]
- Round **3**: Sarahlia use Punishment Sword deduct light, Odin use Restraint Prophecy deduct light [+36/24/12/0 Odin energy:138/126/114/102/90/78] (normal situation round **3** end energy full)
- Round **4**: Odin open realm use two lights output, Sarahlia open big
- Then Odin use 2 lights output, big close, Sarahlia give Odin medicine.
- **2. Empress/+Empress/ Meng Po + Odin + Zi Ya cheap build, average damage, Zi Ya fielding and use 2 lights deduct light.**
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Realm energy acquisition stable and fast, damage not low, can group.
- **Disadvantages** A bit fragile, only hit God restrained, have free King exclusive Freya and high stats **God Xihe** can replace. Opponents often encounter Dragon Mother, Fate these PVE tough ones, Sara and Odin pp both low, easy to be deducted cards to start, fixed damage hit painful, HP low also easy to be Yellow Dragon crit kill.

  4.1.3 Chaos Team System

- **System play core**: **Attack count**
- **Boundary energy acquisition**: Our pets **attack count >5** and at least **1** attack hit gain **15** realm energy points, each pet **first acquisition doubled**, contractor doubled times +1, own each round end no realm energy.
- **System output pets**: **Chaos (Super Dark main C), Fafnir (most commonly used fielding vice C)**
- **Many fielding vice C, attack count >5 can, including new skill group first gen Star Dust, Light Ember Truth after, Light Ember Ai Lin, Light Ember Ye Lan, Secret Treasure 132 and Little Bear, later may add new pets.**
- **System assist pets**: **Empress (self-destruct, universal assist), Meng Po/Empress (self-destruct, universal assist), Zi Ya (self-destruct, universal assist), Lin Lang (Que Huang, universal assist)**
- **Born from Bone Flower - Lilith (non-self-destruct, exclusive assist) Damage increase, crit damage increase**
- **First replacement off field** grants **our full field attack count >5 skill damage and crit damage increase 150%/75%, inheritible, 8 rounds.** Needs **22500 special attack** to maximize buff.
- **Chaos Ash - Erebus (non-self-destruct, contractor, exclusive assist) Attribute reduction, weaken, power increase**
- **Fielding weaken enemy full field all attributes 6 levels; big move enemy full field weaken (all attribute values lower 50%/25%) 8 rounds, our full field attack count >5 skill power increase, max 210%, inheritible, 8 rounds.** Needs **22505 special attack** to maximize buff. **Odd times** using small skill **must attack 7 times**, **big move attack 6 times**.
- **System main C analysis**: Chaos after opening realm **our full field all attributes +6**, **attack count >5 skill crit rate and restraint multiplier increase max 100%**. Rely on **high attack count** for burst output. Small skill single target output, big move can **combo hit lowest HP target once**, but use finish enter unremovable fatigue, subsequent damage lower, so generally realm last round use, for finish.
- **System commonly used lineups**:
- **1. Lilith/Que Huang/Zi Ya/Empress/Meng Po/Burning Angel + Fafnir + Erebus + Chaos double C**
  :::tip
  **Ring Card** most suitable Chaos system, only one suggest Fafnir, none best Dust Card, otherwise Fafnir easy lack damage, Chaos use Su Card general damage enough.
  :::

- **In-battle operations:**
- Round **1**: Zi Ya self-destruct switch Erebus, Fafnir use two lights
- [+30 Chaos energy:30]
- Round **2**: Erebus use Seven Star Scattered Soul, Fafnir use two lights
- [+45 Chaos energy:75]
- Round **3**: Erebus use **big move**, Fafnir use two lights
- [+30 Chaos energy:105]
- Round **4**: Erebus replace Chaos, Fafnir use two lights
- Round **5**: Chaos open realm output, Fafnir use Light Ember
- Erebus can bring Undying Gold Medal, must open big, don't die. Fafnir can change any attack count >5 vice C. Vice C if normal attack pet, avoid Empress/Meng Po.
- **2. Empress + Empress/Lilith/Meng Po/Que Huang + Erebus + Chaos single C energy collection slower**
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Damage very high, system members many, restraint broad, lineup flexible, entertainment strong.
- **Disadvantages** Fragile, own no each round end increase realm energy, single C start relatively slow. Currently employment general have Supreme Glory etc. alternative, no longer necessary, single C can be Light Ember Ai Lin replace.

  4.1.4 Star Nuo Team System

- **System play core**: **Star Nuo attack**
- **Boundary energy acquisition**: Our Star Nuo every round **first use attack skill** gain **8**/**9** realm energy points, each pet **first acquisition doubled,** contractor doubled times +1, extra **10** realm energy points at end of each round.
- **System output pets**: **Moon Star Nuo (Super Dark main C), Star Nuo Ma (Immortal main C), both Boundary Masters.**
- **Mars Nuo (fielding vice C), Dark Star Nuo (fielding vice C), Small Star Nuo (fielding vice C)**
- **System assist pets**: **Sun Star Nuo (self-destruct, single body attribute raise/drop etc.), Holy Spirit Star Nuo (self-destruct, weaken)**
- **System main C analysis**: Star Nuo Ma and Moon Star Nuo through **Star Nuo attack** collect energy, realm use **multi-segment attack skills** deal damage. Star Nuo Ma big move **overflow damage** can splash to another pet, but **use finish enter unremovable fatigue, subsequent damage lower, so generally realm last round use, for finish.** **Moon Star Nuo big move use finish close realm, so also suggest last round use.**
- Vice C all **use big move after strengthen 4 exclusive skills**, compatible with realm. Note Sun Star Nuo only weaken and raise **single body** attribute levels, need **fielding vice C open big** to replicate attributes.
- **System lineups**:
- **1. Sun Star Nuo + Mars Nuo/Dark Star Nuo/Small Star Nuo + Holy Spirit Star Nuo + Star Nuo Ma/Moon Star Nuo**
- Star Nuo pets skills effect need **backpack count ≥4** full buff, so lineup relatively fixed.
- **In-battle operations:**
- Round **1**: Sun Star Nuo self-destruct switch Holy Spirit Star Nuo, Mars Nuo use small skill or medicine
  :::tip
  **Note**: Need protect attributes Sun Star Nuo first round small skill, second round self-destruct
  :::

- [+36/18 Star Nuo Ma energy:46/28]
- Round **2**: Holy Spirit Star Nuo self-destruct switch Star Nuo Ma, Mars Nuo use small skill or medicine
- [+27/18 Star Nuo Ma energy:83/66]
- Round **3**: Star Nuo Ma use small skill, Mars Nuo open big move replicate debuff to another target
- [+27/18 Star Nuo Ma energy:120/94]
- Round **4**: Star Nuo Ma **open realm** use small skill output, Mars Nuo use Burning Heart attack
- Round **7**: Star Nuo Ma according situation choose continue small skill or use big move splash finish
  :::tip
  **Note:** Sun Star Nuo **self-destruct target** generally choose **restrained by Star Nuo Ma** target **or not restrained by vice C** target, Mars Nuo skill whatever.
  :::

- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Build extremely low cost, realm open stable, full team free King exclusive, Star Nuo Ma realm big move splash very good, widely applicable. **Star Nuo Ma has final damage increase for non-restrained non-weak targets**; 6v1 also can use Star Nuo team, very suitable early clearing low stat stages, summer/winter have exclusive buff.
- **Disadvantages:** Lineup fixed; **no restraint multiplier, stats relatively low, for recent high difficulty challenges even with buff hard; only weaken one pet attributes, fielding vice C survival pressure large** Moon Star Nuo has bug, Star Nuo skills cause damage to collect energy, hit immune non-restrained damage stages energy collection slow.

  4.1.5 Samsara Team System

- **System play core**: **Samsara bond** pet attack
- **Boundary energy acquisition**: Our Samsara bond pets every round **first use attack skill** gain **9** realm energy points, each pet **first acquisition doubled,** contractor doubled times +1, extra **10** realm energy points at end of each round
- **System output pets**: **Boundary Mei Bu Si (open boundary), Light Ember Mei Bu Si (main C + contractor).**

- **Soul Eternal Burn - Demon Flame Ji La (non-self-destruct, exclusive assist) HP upper limit, crit damage increase**
- **Big move** our **full field HP and HP upper limit increase 50%**, **max 30000**, **Samsara bond pet crit damage increase**, **max 280%/140%, inheritible, 8 rounds.** Needs **own field 4 rounds** to maximize buff.
- **Verdant Guard - Terminal Rabbit (non-self-destruct, exclusive assist) Dual attack stat increase**
- Fielding grants full field **Samsara bond pet dual attack stat increase, max 50%, inheritible, 8 rounds.** Actually effective any pet, not commonly used, generally with Du.
- **System main C analysis**: Through Samsara bond pet attack collect energy, damage main part Black Mei, can stack two knives one hit. White Mei always use small skill ok. Big move use finish enter unremovable fatigue, subsequent damage lower, so generally realm last round use, for finish.
- **System commonly used lineups**:
- **1. Abyss Dragon + Ji La + Light Ember Mei Bu Si + Boundary Mei Bu Si classic lineup**
- **In-battle operations:**
- Round **1**: Abyss Dragon use small skill/medicine, Ji La use small skill/medicine

- Round **7**: Boundary Mei use small skill, Light Ember Mei use Light Ember and use two lights
- **2. Empress + Abyss Dragon + Burning Angel + Light Ember Mei Bu Si + Boundary Mei Bu Si fielding pressure small, more recommended**
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Basically free, only need cultivate Light Ember Mei Bu Si to form. **Early clearing can use**
- **Disadvantages:** White Mei stats general, damage too low; Abyss Dragon and Ji La field long, certain pressure; Opponent often super electric birth, may have lightning, fast weaken attributes etc. Traditional Samsara team stats too low, unable pass recent high difficulty challenges. Group star points high can use **Empress fire heaven group star black Mei, or find other solutions.**

  4.1.6 Summary

Not hard to see, Boundary Master output idea still **4 round high burst**, encounter stop action troublesome. As **early system**, **disadvantages obvious**, experience not good. **In addition, Boundary Master system exclusive assists basically need** stack attacks to maximize addition, configuration troublesome. Currently only **Realm Descent** occasionally used for special addition, generally have new solutions. Basically not challenge optimal solution, entertainment play only, **not recommend early cultivate**, already cultivated or random diamond forge got can use.

- **Cultivate recommendation** Star Nuo team, Samsara team > Chaos team > Pan Gu team, Odin team
- Boundary main C ≈ fielding vice C > contract pet > other assists double **C no King exclusive not recommend play**

## Hero System

Second gen system team, lineup generally fixed single C, choose based on common restraint two bosses attributes. Besides exclusive fielding assist, use universal self-destruct assist and Starry, cost low.

System core is **Hero pet (system called XX god realm,** since first pet Wumian system called Hero god realm**)** through our pets meet certain conditions collect **50** energy (need on field), energy **full** then **auto release Destiny Judgment** skill **attack (no turn cost)**. Energy collect fast, generally **2** rounds one Destiny Judgment. **Destiny Judgment skill damage high, small skill and big move also good output**, weaken end can effective output, relative Boundary Master and Light Ember more **long term output**, fault tolerance relatively high.

- **Destiny Judgment** needs consume system strengthening stones unlock, besides each Hero has own **contract pet**, contract gain **Hero pet against leader level targets own all stats increase 50%. August 1 update after,** contract pet** no need field **no need cultivate** can make **all stat bonus take effect**. So generally use **Starry pet** provide **restraint multiplier. Since Starry have additional stat bonus, if Starry pet have King exclusive/Otherworld bring 25% restraint multiplier, only need little Starry point auxiliary effect better than fielding assist. Although \*\*this section gives use exclusive assist operation points, actual use more recommend use Starry.
- Our pets **meet specific conditions** can gain **50** energy, **each round** max gain **once** energy; **same pet 2** rounds gain **1** energy; **100** energy release one Destiny Judgment.
- **Realm Descent** Hero pets **energy collect doubled**.
- Hero system generally **lineup relatively fixed**:
- **1. Empress + Empress/Meng Po/Burning Angel + Hero pet + contract pet start fast, operation simple**
  :::tip
  **Operation points:** Must **Empress self-destruct after replace Hero pet**, otherwise can't eat Empress addition. Specific speed details see each system team.
  :::

- **2. Empress/Meng Po/Burning Angel + contract pet/Starry + assist A Lai/Night Sakura + Hero pet body hardest**
  :::tip
  **Operation points:** Empress/Meng Po/Burning Angel self-destruct replace assist A Lai/Night Sakura, latter eat full light fielding open big, back backpack switch Hero pet. If switch order have certain problem.
  If use Starry pet assist, only **Starry switch Hero pet**, other order have certain problem.
  :::

- **3. Empress + Empress/Meng Po/Burning Angel + Starry pet + Hero pet damage highest, most recommended**
  :::tip
  **Operation points:** Empress/Meng Po/Burning Angel if **no Chain**/Source Card, **eat medicine to third round self-destruct**, wait Empress self-destruct finish switch Starry switch Hero pet. First round or second round self-destruct lead **can't eat Starry**. If **have Chain soul weapon**/Source Card, Chain ensure one round no die, direct first round all self-destruct ok, second round **Starry replace Hero pet first speed higher than enemy small skill**. Anyway **recommend Chain soul weapon**, simplify operation flow, reduce fielding pressure, concave double weaken, but note round end fixed damage, carry **Heal Card** heal.
  :::

This lineup 4v2 very common, Hero pet **can change most main C**, like Light Ember pet, Dream Covenant, Summoner etc., operation identical.

### Wumian Team System

- **System play core**: **Unacted**
- **System energy acquisition**: Our pets **attack hit unacted** pets gain **50** energy points.
- **System standard pets**: Main C **Wumian super king type special attack**, universal assist Empress/A Lai and Empress/Meng Po.
- Wumian **self bring restraint multiplier increase**, so **contract pet one life one death** provide not restraint multiplier, **but power blessing, attack unacted pets power increase 120%**. One life one death easier **accumulate energy**.
- **Empress/one life one death** also **replaceable** **Terminal Remnant Echo - Nai Ya**, **first release big move** make our **full field attack unacted pets** crit rate **100%**/**50%**, crit damage increase **280%/140%**, **inheritible**, **10** rounds. Note use Nai Ya and **Starry Luo Lan** best **boss use small skill release big move** collect energy.
- **System main C analysis**: Wumian self passive grant fielding **speed stat increase to full field highest**, replace fielding can **immediate action once**, so not small skill burst basically first hand, one life one death auxiliary form also **all skills first speed increase**. Energy collect very easy.
- **System operation explanation**:
- **With Empress + Empress + Wumian + one life one death example (Meng Po effect slightly higher than Empress)**
  :::tip
  **Note**: In Wumian system team, need ensure **Empress speed less than Empress**, make Wumian **immediate action** attack eat **Empress addition and one life one death field all stat 50% addition, Wumian can give one life one death raise attributes**. Default Empress speed base higher than Empress, no need give Empress speed sub card.
  :::

- Round **1**: Empress, Empress self-destruct, Empress first explode switch 1314, Empress second explode switch Wumian, Wumian immediate action once use small skill.
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (Wumian 50) system energy remaining: 50]
- Round **2**: Wumian small skill, one life one death **switch moon star special** pink auxiliary state
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 system energy remaining: 50]
- Round **3**: Wumian big move, one life one death Light Ember two lights
- [Destiny Judgment x1 (Wumian 50) system energy remaining: 0]
- Round **4**: Wumian small skill, one life one death big move
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (one life one death 50) system energy remaining: 50]
- Round **5**: Wumian small skill, one life one death Light Ember two lights
- [Destiny Judgment x1 (Wumian 50) system energy remaining: 0]
- Round **6**: Wumian big move, one life one death Light Ember two lights
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (one life one death 50) system energy remaining: 50]
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Wheelchair system, Wumian and 1314 both have means increase own speed, random skill also stable accumulate energy. **Wumian fielding increase our full field all stats**, one life one death body hard, survival pressure small. Wumian and 1314 both free King exclusive, separate use also good. Field rate always high.
- **Disadvantages:** Stats higher may need Starry replace 1314. **Secret Treasure Star Dragon** upper tier alternative.

**4.2.2** Amon Team System

- **System play core**: **HP proportion**
- **System energy acquisition**: Our pets attack hit **HP proportion higher than own** targets gain **50** energy points.
- **System standard pets**: **Main C Amon super ancient type special attack**, universal assist Empress/A Lai and Empress/Meng Po.
- **Contract pet messenger** make our attack **HP proportion higher than own** targets **restraint multiplier** increase **100%**.
- **System main C analysis**: Amon system main output Destiny Judgment, energy collect important. Amon fielding **retain 1 HP, other HP convert effective shield**, accumulate energy stable; messenger small skill **deduct current 50% HP convert effective shield**. If **use Starry, energy collect may have certain problem, note Starry attack HP proportion high targets**.
- **System operation explanation**:
- **With Empress + Empress + Amon + messenger example (use Meng Po need carry chair soul weapon round start deduct HP)**
  :::tip
  **Note**: In Amon system team, need ensure **Empress speed higher than Empress**, **Empress fielding deduct own HP, can give Amon accumulate one energy**, give Empress two speed sub cards or talent change add speed.
  :::

- **In-battle operations**:
- Round **1**: Empress self-destruct switch messenger, Empress self-destruct switch Amon
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (Empress 50) system energy remaining: 0 ]
- Round **2**: Amon big move, messenger small skill/eat medicine
- [Destiny Judgment x1 (Amon 50) system energy remaining: 0]
- Round **3**: Amon small skill, messenger big move
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (messenger 50) system energy remaining: 50]
- Round **4**: Amon small skill, messenger small skill/eat medicine
- [Destiny Judgment x1 (Amon 50) system energy remaining: 0]
- Round **5**: Amon big move, messenger small skill
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (messenger 50) system energy remaining: 50]
- Round **6**: Amon small skill, messenger big move
- [Destiny Judgment x1 (Amon 50) system energy: 0]
  :::tip
  **Note**: Only ensure messenger attack HP proportion higher than own enemy ok, messenger note HP
  :::

- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Amon King exclusive free, field frequency high.
- **Disadvantages** Residual energy collect difficult; Amon and messenger both easy explode, Amon HP proportion low easy crit kill, messenger absolute restrained by Spirit pets. Suggest give messenger defense soul card soul weapon and note kill threat large targets.

- **System standard pets**: **Main C Abzu eternal type normal attack**, universal assist Empress/Night Sakura and Burning Angel.
- **Contract pet Ofini** make our **Eternal type pets restraint multiplier** increase **100%**. Small skill grant opponent one **easy damage 2 rounds, max 73%, need normal attack 22630**.
- **System main C analysis**: Through Eternal type pet attack collect energy output, very crude.
- **System operation explanation**:
- **With Empress + Burning Angel + Abzu + Ofini example Empress and Burning Angel speed whatever)**
- Round **1**: Empress Burning Angel self-destruct, Burning Angel switch Ofini, Empress switch Dragon Abzu
- [Destiny Judgment 0/100 system energy remaining: 0]
- Round **2**: Ofini use big move, Dragon Abzu use small skill
- [Destiny Judgment 50/100 (Ofini 50) system energy remaining: 50]
- Round **3**: Ofini use small skill, Dragon Abzu use big move

- Round **5**: Ofini use big move, Dragon Abzu use big move
- [Destiny Judgment x1 (Dragon Abzu 50) system energy remaining: 0]
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Operation very mindless
- **Disadvantages** Eternal type restraint broad no Starry, face high stats very eat force, may need double weaken pass; Ofini easy die, bring meat soul card soul weapon; Common opponents group elite including high fixed damage ink ink, clear debuff tree spirit, immune negative + chaos soul first gen Empress, chaos soul Glory Galaxy etc. **Generally use Supreme Glory replace**.

**4.2.4** Xiaoyao Team System

- **System operation explanation**:
- **With Empress + Burning Angel + Xiaoyao + Donghuang Taiyi example**
  :::tip
  In Xiaoyao system team, recommend **Empress speed higher than Burning Angel**, Burning Angel and Empress self-destruct same target can give Xiaoyao collect one energy. Give Empress two speed sub cards or talent change add speed.

  Default Burning Angel speed base higher than Empress, no need give Burning Angel speed sub card.
  :::

**4.2.12** Summary

Hero output idea more toward **long term operation**, more persistent stable, operation very simple. Most obtain difficulty low, cultivate cost also low. Since single C lineup, some situations also can use Light Ember replace. Besides some also can be Supreme Glory systems replace. But with Summoner system release, pve stats have obvious inflation, part low stat old systems no longer priority recommend cultivate. Chess Lin King after systems stats higher, even Otherworld usable, recommend cultivate.

- **Cultivate recommendation** Wumian team, Amon team, Chess Lin King team > Angel King team, Xihe team, Immortal Dragon team > other

## Supreme Glory System

- **Supreme Glory systems include system called Supreme Glory** pets, currently **Phoenix, Galaxy, A Lai, Abzu, Dragon Mother and Xihe**, later may add more.
  Supreme Glory system **play very simple**, each member can use **system skill Supreme Blessing self-destruct**, or use **exclusive skill and big move output**. Each obtain one pet after, can **consume 50 system strengthening stones light system, all Supreme Glory pets self-destruct give corresponding effect (regardless who self-destruct). Contract self-destruct effective, no need Otherworld/King exclusive. Two King exclusives can temporary use.**
- **Phoenix: Weaken single enemy 6 level all attributes and make all attribute values lower 50%/25%, 10 rounds.**
- **Galaxy: Raise next field Supreme Glory pet 6 level all attributes and crit rate increase 100%/50%, inheritible, 10 rounds.**
- **A Lai: Supreme Glory pet power increase 150%/75%, inheritible, 10 rounds.**
- **Abzu: Supreme Glory pet damage increase 200%/150%, inheritible, 10 rounds.**
- **Dragon Mother: Supreme Blessing power increase and damage increase effect value and max increase 30%.**
- **Xihe: Next field Supreme Glory pet each round first attack hit random deduct 5 level attributes, inheritible, 10 rounds; all attribute values increase, effect depend next field pet wear Otherworld or King exclusive. If King exclusive increase 40%/20%, if Otherworld increase 30%/15%.**
  :::tip
  **Note: Supreme Blessing and skills increase need backpack Supreme Glory pet count =4 to take effect.**
  :::

- **Lineup: Any two self-destruct + attacker 1 + attacker 2 self-destruct remember give Awareness Card**
- Remember two respectively **self-destruct different targets** ok. Operation very simple, have hand.
- **Attacker 1 and Attacker 2 can same pet,** generally called **replicant**, this Supreme Glory system essence. Replicant damage high, e.g. two A Lai (Void) damage higher than Xiaoyao team, two Abzu (Eternal) damage higher than Eternal team. Actually 12 pets Supreme Glory complete body.
  If no replicant but still want **single C**, e.g. use one Dragon Mother hit two super spacetime, can **first self-destruct one** let main C field, another **bring meat** rely small skill suck attributes **fielding**, kill one after switch back, refresh buff round number. Opponent output high may not.
- **System pros and cons**:
- **Advantages** Damage very high, operation have hand, many applicable scenes; Recent planner push, later may add strength. Obtain relatively simple, occasionally activity free King exclusive.
- **Disadvantages** Fragile, easy die; Basically need King exclusive, cultivate cost very high.
- **Cultivate suggestion:(Represent personal and part group friends view)**
  Although Supreme Glory system keep add strength and planner push, still **not recommend early cultivate**, clearing time basically useless, generally have other solutions. Anyway at least **Summoner, common Hero and Light Ember** cultivate finish say,** can through various self-select activities slowly add**. Otherworld Supreme Glory experience very poor,** at least ensure two attackers King exclusive**, replicant can first Otherworld.

:::tip
**Recommend cultivate order: Dragon Mother > A Lai > Abzu > Xihe > Phoenix > Galaxy (represent personal recommend)**

## Summoner System

Latest generation system team, lineup composition close Boundary Master, can single C or double C, have exclusive assist, also can use universal assist. Design like Boundary Master and Hero combine.

- **System commonly used lineups: Star Nuo Ma self bring high crit damage, Empress effect good than Meng Po**
- **1. Empress + Empress + Hua Ying Ji + Summon Star Nuo Ma single C lineup, damage high**
- **2. Empress + Summon Star Nuo Ma + A Lai + Boundary Star Nuo Ma double C lineup, survival more stable, energy collect fast**
- **3. Sun Star Nuo + Dark Star Nuo + Holy Spirit Star Nuo + Summon Star Nuo Ma double C lineup, also can only rely Summon Star Nuo Ma main C.

- **2. Burning Angel + Star Ring Nuwa + Night Sakura + Pan Gu double C lineup, lineup 1 low tier, damage about 60%**
- **3. Empress + Burning Angel + Starry + Pan Gu single C lineup, cost lowest. Since Nuwa provide addition less, Pan Gu single C general no Nuwa.**
