# Pet Introduction

This chapter introduces the skills and roles of pets.

## Basic Mechanics Supplement

### Skill Priority

- **Guangqi vs. Non-Guangqi:** Possesses 99% true resistance, gains boss-like abilities, but is not a boss. Non-Guangqi pet PVP execution/reset skills are ineffective against Guangqi pets. Xinghui vs. non-Xinghui non-Guangqi, possesses 95% true resistance, considered a boss. Non-Xinghui non-Guangqi pet PVP execution/reset skills are ineffective against Xinghui pets.

- **Skill Priority:** **Guangqi Burst Skill** > Super Xinghui Ultimate > Otherworldly Ultimate > Legendary Ultimate > Super Aoyi > **Guangqi Small Skill** > Xinghui Small Skill > Otherworldly Small Skill > Legendary Small Skill > Ultimate Transformation. Note that **different Guangqi systems have different priorities. For example, Guangjin's priority is equal to Guangqi's small skill.**
- Note that some skills will be marked as **priority equal to Guangqi Burst Skill, such as Zhigao Blessing.**
- Super Fast Priority +1 > Super Fast > Normal
- (1) Ultimate Priority
- Guangqi Burst Skill Priority +1 > Guangqi Burst Skill > Super Xinghui Ultimate Super Fast Speed > Super Xinghui Ultimate > Otherworldly Ultimate Super Fast Speed > Otherworldly Ultimate > Legendary Ultimate
- (2) Small Skill Priority
- **Guangqi First Move Light Energy Skill > Guangqi Light Energy Skill > Guangqi First Move PP Skill > Guangqi PP Skill** > Xinghui Three-Star First Move > Xinghui Three-Star > Xinghui Skill > Otherworldly First Move Skill > Otherworldly Normal > Last Move
- (3) **Switching Pet Priority**
- **Guangqi Burst > Xinghui Burst > Switch Pet > Use Item > Small Skill**
- Guangqi/Xinghui/Otherworldly/Legendary/Aoyi **normal ultimate skills have cross-generational priority over normal small skills. For example: Xinghui ultimate/Otherworldly ultimate/Super Aoyi are faster than Guangqi small skills.**

### Damage Resistance: True Resistance and False Resistance

- **True Resistance: Reduces all damage.** Red direct damage (skill direct damage), purple fixed damage (deduction, absorption, percentage), therefore can **reduce yellow total damage. Only [Lust] Caesar can reduce it among pets.**
- **False Resistance: Can only reduce red direct damage. The resistance reduced by Yue is false resistance.**
  :::tip
  The upper limit of single-hit red direct damage is 999,999 (rounded to 1 million).
  The increase and decrease of true resistance can affect the damage limit.
  The #resistance increase# given in system levels is generally false resistance; damage reduction is true resistance.
  :::

### Difference between Attack Count and Combo Count

- **Multiple attacks from a skill (multi-hit) and combos are different.**
- **Multi-hit:** A skill that can deal ≥2 red direct damages in one go is a multi-hit skill.
- The skill description is **attacks the target x times/attack count +x.**
- **Combo:** After **releasing a skill**, **automatically releasing the skill again** is a combo. The skill description is **combo.**

The main difference is that **multi-hit is only one action; while a combo is multiple actions**. Therefore, if the target is defeated, if there are remaining combo counts, it will pursue other targets/switch targets; multi-hit will not.

- **The buffs for attack count and combo count** are different, so it is necessary to distinguish between these two concepts.
- **Example: Yao Wang Lie's Wanyao Baizhan attack count +[1, 99] Multi-hit**
- **Guangjin Suisuiqi's combo once with this skill Combo**
- **Kaos system team attack count >5 Multi-hit**
- **Sheng Tianyi system team combo skill Combo**

## General Support

(All are King exclusive effects, numerical values are all maximum values, **those marked with ★ are commonly used support**)

- **Support F4:** Refers to **Empress, Ziya, Dragon King, and Black Wing**, general support for 6v1. Empress and Ziya are the most important, followed by the Dragon King. All three can be obtained from the first purchase, or with star coins. Black Wing is relatively less important.

- **Support F4:** Refers to **Empress, Ziya, Dragon King, and Black Wing**, general support for 6v1. Empress and Ziya are the most important, followed by the Dragon King. All three can be obtained from the first purchase, or with star coins. Black Wing is relatively less important.
- **1. Yongsheng Hanyu - Bingxue Nühuang ★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction, attribute lock, attribute increase, critical hit and critical damage increase, attribute protection**
  Gains **5** light energy upon entering the field, **deducts 2 light energy from the entire enemy team**; ultimate sacrifices self to **reduce a single target's all attributes by 6 levels, ignoring protection**, **prevents attribute level increase for 15 rounds**, **reduces numerical values by 15%, ignoring protection**, our **attribute levels are increased to the maximum, critical hit rate +100%, critical damage +200%, inheritable, 15 rounds.** The next pet to enter the field **takes -99% direct damage, 2 rounds**. 1-light skill **protects attribute levels and stats**, **inheritable**, **15 rounds**.

- **Note:** Very versatile, a must-have for both 6v1 and 4v2. Use attribute protection when facing enemies with strong attribute reduction abilities. **No need for the Cuican version!**

- **2. Daitian Fengshen - Jiang Ziya ★: Self-destruct, stat reduction, stat increase, HP lock**
  Enters the field with **full** light energy, immune to all skills for **1** round, inflicts **a 50% reduction of current stats on the entire enemy team for 20 rounds;** ultimate sacrifices self, inflicts **inability to recover HP on a single target for 20 rounds;** upon first departure (death/switch), our **all-attribute stats are increased by 70% of the entry value, with a single stat cap of 15,000, HP and HP limit are increased by 50% of the entry value, with a maximum HP limit of 50,000, inheritable, 20 rounds.** The first two uses of the 1-light skill **deduct 2 light energy from the enemy**.

- **Note:** Commonly used in 6v1, sometimes can be used to stay on the field in 4v2. Since most Guangqi bosses have low HP recovery, it's not always necessary to self-destruct. Note that the stat reduction is based on the current value. Some bosses may have **Xingmeng**, which increases their stats upon entering the field. Ziya alone cannot reduce them to the lowest level. You can bring other debuffing pets like Nüdi, Huo Tianshi, etc.

- **3. Sihai Taotian - Ao Xing ★: Self-destruct, damage reduction, attribute reduction, chance to dodge, light energy return**
  Gains **6** light energy upon entering the field and **resistance +80% for 1 round**; ultimate sacrifices self, inflicts on a single target **increased attribute levels are doubled and reduced at the end of the round for 12 rounds**, our pets **take -60% direct damage**, **60% immune to attack skills, 25% chance to return the light energy consumed this round at the end of the round, damage +150%, inheritable, 12 rounds**.

- **Note:** Generally only used in 6v1, can greatly increase survivability, and the light energy return is also very important.

- **4. Jueying Shiyue - Heiyi Wang ★: Self-destruct, damage increase, healing**
- Enters the field with full light energy **and increases its own HP and HP limit by 75%, and all attributes by 60%**; ultimate sacrifices self, grants our side **damage +200%, and heals 15,000 HP on the first skill use each round, inheritable, 20 rounds**.
- Used in 6v1. Most attackers have a self-healing of 15,000 HP per round. When facing high-damage bosses, it can improve survivability. The damage bonus is relatively small, so it can be replaced with other support pets.

- **Xinuo F4: Taiyang, Shengling, Long, and Mu four Xinuo** function similarly to Empress, Ziya, Dragon King, and Black Wing, but if the attacker is not a Xinuo family pet, the provided buffs will only have 75% effect. When the attacker's stats are high or the boss's stats are low, this is completely sufficient. They need to be used together, otherwise the bonus will be reduced.
- **5. Riyao Qiji - Taiyang Xinuo ★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction, attribute lock, attribute increase, critical hit and critical damage increase, attribute protection**
  Gains **5** light energy upon entering the field; ultimate sacrifices self to **reduce a single target's all attributes by 6 levels, ignoring protection**, **prevents attribute level increase for 12/8 rounds**, our **attribute levels +6/4, critical hit rate +100%/75%, critical damage +200%/150%, inheritable, 15 rounds.** The next pet to enter the field **takes -99%/75% direct damage, 2 rounds.** Small skill **100%/75% protects attribute levels and stats**, **inheritable**, **15 rounds**.

- **Note:** Since Taiyang Xinuo can carry a soul weapon, it can use a chain to protect its attributes with its small skill first.

- **7. Xingguang Qiji - Shengling Xinuo ★: Self-destruct, stat reduction, stat increase, HP lock**
  Enters the field with **full** light energy, inflicts **a 50% reduction of current stats on the entire enemy team for 20 rounds;** ultimate sacrifices self, inflicts **inability to recover HP on a single target for 20 rounds;** upon first departure (death/switch), our **all-attribute stats are increased by 70%/52.5% of the entry value, with a single stat cap of 15,000/11,250, HP and HP limit are increased by 50%/37.5% of the entry value, with a maximum HP limit of 50,000/37,500, inheritable, 20 rounds.**

- **8. Chaojie Qiji - Long Xinuo ★: Self-destruct, damage reduction, chance to dodge, light energy return**
  Gains **5** light energy upon entering the field and **resistance +80% for 1 round**; ultimate sacrifices self, our pets **take -60%/45% direct damage**, **60%/30% immune to attack skills, 25%/18.75% chance to return the light energy consumed this round at the end of the round, damage +150%/112.5%, inheritable, 12 rounds**.

- **9. Tiandi yu Wo Jingzheng Ziyou - Xiaoyao: Self-destruct, dodge, stat lock, extra light energy**
- **Use the new skill set.** Gains **4** light energy upon entering the field; ultimate sacrifices self, inflicts **inability to increase stats on the enemy for 5/7 rounds**; upon departure (death/switch), grants **the next pet to enter the field 150% dodge for (2 + number of enemies / 2, rounded down) attack skills for 3 rounds, with a 4-round cooldown, and gains 1 extra light energy for 5 rounds if no damage is taken each round.**
- **Note:** If the boss has a precision buff, it may ignore our dodge, but the 150% dodge rate provided by Xiaoyao is generally not ignored. It is used less often, when facing special pets with very high damage or in combination with the fixed damage Pandora.

- **10. Huanhai Qiji - Shui Xinuo: Self-destruct, dodge, stat lock, extra light energy**
  Gains **4** light energy upon entering the field; ultimate sacrifices self, inflicts **inability to increase stats on the enemy for 5/7 rounds**; after leaving the field (death/switch), grants **the next pet to enter the field 100%/75% dodge for (2 + number of enemies / 2, rounded down) attack skills for 5 rounds, and has a 100%/60% chance to gain 1 extra light energy for 5 rounds if no damage is taken each round.**

- **Note:** When facing special pets with very high damage, it can replace Mu Xinuo/Long Xinuo.

- **11. Qunxing zhi Yu ★**: **Non-self-destruct, super-effective multiplier for our pets of the same type, special attack/normal attack stat bonus**
- **When using, click on the constellation blessing and then switch**, **see 3.2 for details.**
- **Note:** Almost a must-have for 6v1, also very good in 4v2. The disadvantage is that it needs to be accumulated.

- **12. Version's Child: Self-destruct, damage bonus against specified type bosses**
- The Version's Child does not have a dedicated system. Its characteristic is that its ultimate self-destructs to obtain XX·Gong, which provides a **damage bonus against bosses of three specified types (most are initially 150%, Otherworldly 225%, King exclusive 300%)**, **inheritable, 10 rounds**.
- Quick reference for choosing the Version's Child based on the boss's attribute:
- (1) [Yuanfen Yixian Qian - Xiao Huxian] Eternal, Life, Immortal
- (2) [Leyuan Shouhuzhe - Xingguang Jiaodoushi] Divine Weapon, Fighting, Flying
- (3) [Bingfeng zhi Xin - Yisha Nüwang] Fairy Spirit, Dark Star, Illusion
- (4) [Guzhu Yizhi - Touzi Dawang] Digital, Super Earth, Super Electric
- (5) [Wuye Damaoxian - Heiye Tongxin] Divine Weapon, Fighting, Flying
- (6) [Hanbing zhi Quan - Bingquan Aisi] Ancient, Holy Spirit, Super King **King exclusive damage bonus 350%, Otherworldly 300%**
- (7) [Dayao Xuemai - Yao Wang Lie] Mystic, Spacetime, Super God **Occasionally useful due to the high number of skill hits.**
- (8) [Qingshi zhi Han - Shizu Binglong] Super Dragon, Super Light, Super Dark **Can get King exclusive for free**
- (9) [Shamo zhi Xin - Anubisi] Ancient, Super King, Holy Spirit **Can get King exclusive for free**
- (10) [Juanlian Dajiang - Sha Wujing] Annihilation, Heaven and Earth, Complete **Can get King exclusive for free**
- (11) [Tianpeng Yuanshuai - Zhu Bajie] Super Water, Super Fire, Super Wood **Can get King exclusive for free**
- **How to obtain: Version Benefits → Sign-in Gifts → Self-select Version's Child**
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize those with free exclusives. Secondly, Touzi Dawang is a divine weapon. The contract pet can increase damage by releasing its ultimate, so it can be bound to the Empress. Since the self-destructing Version's Child pets have already covered all types, the subsequently released Version's Child pets are all Super-dimensional pets that can be obtained for free from the monthly dungeon (entrance: Challenge Trial → Time Dungeon).
- **Note:** Both Otherworldly and King exclusives can self-destruct upon entering the field. They generally self-destruct before Black Wing, otherwise Black Wing's healing will make the Version's Child immortal. Since the damage bonus of the Version's Child will be diluted, its effect is far inferior to that of the constellation. It is generally used less in challenges, and only used in 6v1 where damage is lacking or in fantasy epics where pets are sealed.

- **13**.**Ningchen Zaojie zhi Xingshen - Xingchen**: **Self-destruct, attribute lock, extra light energy, power increase**
- Gains **6** light energy upon entering the field; ultimate sacrifices self, the **next pet to enter the field** **gains 4 extra light energy each round for 5 rounds**, **skill power is increased by 50% of the light energy consumed, up to 200%**, **10** rounds.
- In PVE, it is generally used with pets that **mainly rely on their ultimate for output**, and can also be used with **Guangjin pets**.

- **14**.**Chiyue Daoji - Yue**: **Non-self-destruct, resistance reduction, light deduction**
- **Each attack** adds **1** stack of **Chiyue mark for 20 rounds** to the target, **each stack reduces resistance by 10%, up to 5 stacks, reducing resistance to 0% at most, and increasing damage taken by 100% when resistance is 0%**. 2-light inflicts **light energy drain on the target (deducts 1 light energy at the end of each round, lasting for X rounds, where X is the number of Chiyue mark stacks**). Upon leaving the field, **automatically uses the 2-light skill once on the entire enemy team**. To stack marks quickly, you can use **Mishu Feijian (can combo once when attacking a pet with a higher HP percentage than yourself), and the ultimate is guaranteed to attack twice**.
- **Note:** Rarely used, only useful when the boss has built-in damage resistance. Can be used with Dijeishi Odin, but is rarely used.

- **15. Tianmi Xinshi - Yuzhe: Self-destruct, single-hit damage increase**
- Gains **5** light energy upon entering the field; ultimate sacrifices self, causes the enemy to **take 60% fixed damage in addition to the highest single-hit damage received each round,** up to **600,000, for 8 rounds.**
- **Note:** An early-stage support, rarely used. Its few uses are in combination with the first-generation Yeying/Pandora.

- **16. Chenshi Fanhua - Alaya-vijnana: Non-self-destruct, rejuvenation, light energy lock, power increase**
  Enters the field with **full** light energy; ultimate **increases power by 30% of the light energy consumed**, **up to 180%**, **inheritable, 10 rounds;** upon departure, grants **the next pet 1 rejuvenation (recovers 25% of max HP when taking fatal damage, up to 20,000) and increases dual defense by 20% of the entry value for 15 rounds, and locks light energy for 3 rounds. 2-light forces itself to retreat.**

- **Note:** An early-stage support. To cooperate with ultimate-type attackers, it needs to enter the field early to accumulate light energy. **Basically replaced by Xingchen**.

- **17. Shiyin Miman · Luoxi: Self-destruct, damage increase (Xinghui pet)**
- Enters the field with **5** stars, ultimate sacrifices self, causes **our pets' damage to increase by 20% each round, up to 200%, inheritable, infinite rounds**.
- **Note:** An early-stage support. Due to settlement issues and the need for development, it is a lower-tier replacement for Heiyi Wang.

- **18. Menghuan Qili zhi Ye - Xihe: Non-self-destruct, lifesteal, critical damage (Xinghui pet)**
- Applies the Menghuan mark to the enemy upon entering the field. Attacking a target with the mark **grants +100% lifesteal** and **+50% critical damage**, **infinite rounds**.
- **Note:** An early-stage support, suitable for high-damage targets to ensure survivability. Can also be used with Du.

- **The following support effects are related to the number of our pets on the field, with the maximum effect at =2 (red number) and the effect at =1 in blue.**
- **19. Huanyu Jiechen - Nüdi ★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction, debuff, special attack pet damage increase**
- Enters the field with **full** light energy; ultimate sacrifices self, **reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels, and debuffs (all-attribute stats are reduced by 50%/25%) for 10 rounds; our side gains a 200%/100% increase in special attack skill damage, inheritable, for 10 rounds; the next pet to enter the field immediately gains 4 light energy.**
- **Note:** A **general** support for **special attack** pets in 4v2, and has a free King exclusive. It will **deduct 20% of its own HP** upon entering the field, so it **cannot trigger the chain soul weapon**. Heiyi Wang's blessing/**Yuan card** can make it immortal after self-destructing.

- **20. Youquan Shizhe - Mengpo ★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction, debuff, special attack pet critical damage increase**
  Enters the field with **full** light energy, **deducts 3 light energy from the opposing pet**; ultimate sacrifices self, **reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels, and debuffs (all-attribute stats are reduced by 50%/25%) for 10 rounds; our side gains a 200%/100% increase in special attack skill critical damage, inheritable, for 10 rounds; the next pet to enter the field immediately gains 4 light energy.**

- **Note:** A **general** support for **special attack** pets in 4v2. Whether Mengpo or Nüdi deals more damage depends on whether your output has built-in critical damage. If the output has a lot of built-in critical damage, use Nüdi, otherwise use Mengpo.
- **Dual Debuff Strategy:** You can achieve **immortality after self-destructing** by **carrying a chain with the soul weapon**. Since the chain locks HP for 1 round, combined with the Yu card's end-of-round healing, you can switch it out in the second round. When the debuff and critical damage bonus end, switch in the support pet. By hoping the opponent doesn't attack Mengpo, you can achieve **another self-destruct**, which is equivalent to **extending the duration of the buff**. This requires luck but can effectively increase damage. You can consider this strategy when your configuration is insufficient.

- **21. Shenghuo Chitianshi - Selefu ★: Self-destruct, debuff, normal attack pet critical damage increase**
- Enters the field with **full** light energy; ultimate sacrifices self, **reduces the entire enemy team's all attributes by 6 levels, and debuffs (all-attribute stats are reduced by 50%/25%) for 10 rounds; our side gains a 200%/100% increase in normal attack skill critical damage, inheritable, for 10 rounds; the next pet to enter the field immediately gains 4 light energy.**
- **Note:** A **general** support for **normal attack** pets in 4v2. You can get the body and King exclusive for free from the Daren Wang. You can also get the body from the summoning array and the divine pet secret realm.

- **22. Wuming Wushi zhi Jing - Alaya-vijnana ★: Non-self-destruct, attribute increase, special attack pet critical hit increase, power increase**
- **Returns to the backpack immediately after releasing the ultimate**, grants teammates **a counterattack with their exclusive skill once when attacked**, **increases special attack skill critical hit rate by 100%/50%, and power by 150%/75%**, **inheritable, for 10 rounds; upon first departure**, grants **our entire team 6 levels of all attributes (only includes currently fielded pets and replacement pets, not inheritable)**.
- **Note:** A **general** support for **special attack** pets in 4v2, and has a free King exclusive. It also increases critical hit rate and attribute levels, but is generally **not as effective as Bingxue Nühuang**, unless it is a **dual special attack DPS** team like the Fantian team, but the Fantian team also has better alternatives. Another advantage is that it can **increase the level of the support pet on the field**, increasing survivability. In addition, it can be pulled out by Abisi in 6v1 as a fielded pet, and its ultimate can be used to apply a counterattack to increase output.

- **23. Yueying Yingyelan - Yeying ★: Non-self-destruct, attribute increase, normal attack pet critical hit increase, power increase**
- **Returns to the backpack immediately after releasing the ultimate**, **dispels 2 of the opponent's most recently acquired buffs with a duration of less than 10 rounds**, grants teammates **a 100%/50% increase in normal attack skill critical hit rate and a 150%/75% increase in power**, **inheritable, for 10 rounds; upon first departure**, grants **our entire team 6 levels of all attributes (only includes currently fielded pets and replacement pets, not inheritable)**. Small skill can inflict **2** instances of **40% increased damage taken** on the target for **3** rounds.
- **Note:** A **general** support for **normal attack** pets in 4v2. It is generally **not as effective as Bingxue Nühuang** and is used relatively less often. It is generally used in normal attack teams or normal attack dual DPS teams where the support pet is very easily killed by direct damage.

## Constellation Feather (Support)

Constellation Feather pets, or **constellations** for short, are very important support pets, commonly used in both 6v1 and 4v2.

![](/aola/pet-dictionary_069.png) Pets with this system icon are Constellation Feather pets, sometimes also called **Shooting Star Children**.

- **Constellation Role:** When fighting against enemies that are **super-effective against the constellation's type**, using a constellation support of the **same type** as the attacker can provide a powerful **super-effective multiplier and stat bonus**, with a very significant damage increase.
- **Constellation Points: Click "Obtain Starlight" in the system.** Each constellation pet's **body** and **King exclusive equipment each** count as one starlight point (Otherworldly cannot). Each starlight point requires **100 system enhancement stones** to obtain. ![](/aola/pet-dictionary_070.png)
- **Constellation Point Allocation:** Click the icon to light it up. The left half is the **normal attack** area, and the right half is the **special attack** area. Remember that **the super-effective multiplier has the highest priority**. Prioritize the first-priority **large stars**. When you don't have enough points, prioritize the small **special attack/normal attack** points. The image does not show it, but the constellation configuration can now be **saved as a preset**. It is recommended to have one set for normal attack and one for special attack.
- **Constellation Usage:** When a constellation is the first pet, there is no level limit. When it is not the first pet, it needs to be max level. **Click the Constellation Feather** icon to get the constellation blessing. The **priority** of the constellation skill release depends on the action of the current round, usually taking medicine/switching pets.
- **Constellation Blessing: 10/15** rounds, obtains all bonuses of the Constellation Feather type, **inheritable** to the **next** pet of the same type.
- **Note:** If the pet switched in after the constellation is used is of a **different type from the constellation**, and then switched to a pet of the same type, the constellation blessing can still be inherited (e.g., Holy Spirit → King → Holy Spirit can still inherit the blessing) and the rounds are not counted in between.
- If you switch to a pet of the **same type** and receive the constellation blessing, **switching again** will cause the constellation blessing to disappear.
- (e.g., Longyin Shou → Longwang → 1314, 1314 cannot receive the constellation blessing)
- The constellation blessing is only for **itself and the pet it switches to**, not the entire field. Pay special attention to this in 4v2. Don't forget to activate the constellation blessing before Abisi pulls the constellation to the field;
- The constellation points of a borrowed pet use **your own** constellation points. After a pet **receives the constellation blessing**, switching attributes (such as Du, Xinglong transforming, Mipan switching divine personality) will still allow it to continue using the blessing.
- **Quick Reference Table (1-16 can be exchanged for the body in the summoning array, 1-19 can be exchanged for the body and King exclusive in the domain, 21 can be obtained for free from the current battle pass, 30 Ao coins for the King exclusive. In addition, some events may also give them away)**:
- (1) [Quling Shenbu - Linlang] Super God Type Constellation ★
- (2) [1 Haoji - Turing] Super Digital Type Constellation ★
- (3) [Yujin Chuwang - Luolan] Super King Type Constellation ★
- (4) [Binglong zhi Zi - Bingluo Huang] Super Water Type Constellation
- (5) [Yilong zhi Zi - Lingfeng] Super Electric Type Constellation ★
- (6) [Yilong zhi Zi - Yinfeng] Super Flying Type Constellation
- (7) [Yinglong zhi Zi - Dika] Super Light Type Constellation ★
- (8) [Julong zhi Zi - Mingwang] Super Earth Type Constellation ★

- (15) [Hanshuang Liren - Liepo] Super Divine Weapon Type Constellation
- (16) [Zhongji Leiting - Tiequan Daishu] Super Fighting Type Constellation
- (17) [Shiyuan Liefeng - Shijian zhi Shen] Super Spacetime Type Constellation ★
- (18) [Honglian Jinran - Yu Xingli] Super Ancient Type Constellation
- (19) [Shengyong Yutianshi - Yin] Super Heaven and Earth Type Constellation ★
- (20) [Heiyuan Anyi - Hundun Julong] Dark Star Type Constellation
- (21) [Yuhun Wunü - Huayingji] Life Type Constellation
- **Note:** Otherworldly and King exclusives can provide an additional **25** super-effective multiplier. Other effects are all damage increases (constellations can also be used as low-stat attackers), and not having them does not affect their use. However, they need to be cultivated to increase their tankiness to stay on the field.

## Divine Weapon Pets (Out-of-Battle Support)

- **Guangqi Divine Weapon** pets, or Divine Weapons for short, can provide a certain bonus to pets after being bound in the system, without needing to be in battle.
- ![](/aola/pet-dictionary_071.png) Pets with this system icon are **Guangqi Divine Weapon** pets, and their attributes are xx type + Super Divine Weapon type.
  ![](/aola/pet-dictionary_072.png)

- **After the Divine Weapon is contracted,** it can provide **Divine Weapon Power** to **all pets**, and only provides **Divine Weapon Blessing** to pets of the **destined type**.
- **Divine Weapon Power:** As long as the contract is made, you can get the corresponding **stat bonus of the Divine Weapon, which increases with the level of the Divine Weapon system**.
- **Note:** In fact, the stat bonus has **no upper limit**, and it is not increased according to the Divine Weapon pet's own stats, but as a percentage of the **bound pet's stats** (after the system is maxed out, it is [bound pet's stats / 1500]%).
- This means that **the bonus has nothing to do with the Divine Weapon itself**! The Divine Weapon **does not need to be cultivated**. It is enough to give the second type to the Otherworldly. Unless you have a lot of money or can get it for free, you should consider giving the commonly used Divine Weapon to the King at the end.
- **Destined Type:** A Divine Weapon **generally** has **two destined types**, which are the Divine Weapon pet's own type + an additional destined type. Both Otherworldly and King can unlock the second destined type.
- **Divine Weapon Blessing:** Only when the contracted pet's type is the same as the Divine Weapon's two **destined types** can the Divine Weapon Blessing be activated. The Divine Weapon Blessing increases with the level of the Divine Weapon system, and **only the King exclusive** can **additionally increase** it.
- Each Divine Weapon requires **200 system enhancement stones** to max out the system.
- The Divine Weapon Blessing is **20 rounds** under normal circumstances, **takes effect on the first entry**, and **disappears upon replacement**. Once the Divine Weapon Blessing is obtained, switching forms, etc., which causes the attributes to change, will not cause the Divine Weapon Blessing to disappear.
- **Common Divine Weapon Blessing types** (numerical values are all **total damage increase values**):
- **Damage Increase · Divine Weapon** provides a damage bonus.
- **Divine Weapon Power** bonus is **10**:
- Initial damage increase is **5%**; **system maxed out** damage increase is **35%**; **equipped with King exclusive** damage increase is **60%**.
- **Divine Weapon Power** bonus is **15**.
- Initial damage increase is **30%**; **system maxed out** damage increase is **60%**; **equipped with King exclusive** damage increase is **100%**.
- **2. Critical Damage Increase · Divine Weapon** provides a critical damage bonus. **Currently only** Luoxi and Sheng Tianyi.
- **Divine Weapon Power** bonus is **15%** for both.
- Initial critical damage increase is **10%**; **system maxed out** critical damage increase is **60%**; **equipped with King exclusive** critical damage increase is **120%**.
- **Note:** The Divine Weapon and the bound pet must have the **same skill set**. (If you use a **new skill set Divine Weapon** to bind an **old skill set pet**, the old skill set pet **can still** receive the blessing, but if you use an **old skill set** to bind a **new skill set** pet, it **cannot receive the bonus**).
- **Old Divine Weapon** bound to an **old skill set pet** will have its increased stats displayed on the **out-of-battle panel**, so it is **effective in both PVP and PVE**; **new skill set** Divine Weapon's increased stats are **not displayed** on the backpack pet panel, but are displayed in battle, and are only effective against leaders (PVE). In PVP, the Divine Weapon only has attack effects and buffs displayed, but there is actually no bonus.
- **6v1 recommended stat Divine Weapon** (special attack/normal attack is the same as the attacker, prioritize receiving the **Divine Weapon Power** bonus), **4v2** it is better to receive the **Divine Weapon Blessing**, of course, it is better to receive both.
- **A Divine Weapon pet can only be contracted to one pet.** Click on **All Divine Weapons** in the system interface to **quickly change** the pets bound to all Divine Weapons, and at the same time, you can view the destined attributes of all Divine Weapon pets (including those not yet obtained).

- **Note:** Roughly estimated, binding a Divine Weapon can **increase damage by at least 10%**. It is recommended to bind the Divine Weapon to the most commonly used attacker of that type. When you are lacking damage, you should also check whether you have bound a suitable Divine Weapon. If you are too lazy to change, you can get a few more.
- All Divine Weapon pets **have the Super Divine Weapon type**. As bosses, they may have an impact on type effectiveness, but you generally don't need to worry about it. On the other hand, they can benefit from the Super Divine Weapon type constellation. Those with free King exclusives can be used as low-stat attackers.
