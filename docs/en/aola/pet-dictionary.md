# Pet Introduction

This chapter introduces pet skills and their roles.

## Basic Mechanisms Supplement

### Skill Priority

- **Light Initiation vs Non-Light Initiation** has 99% True Resistance, gains boss ability, not equal to boss. Non-Light Initiation pet PvP effective slay/reset does not work on Light Initiation pets; Starlight vs Non-Starlight Non-Light Initiation has 95% True Resistance, considered boss. Non-Starlight Non-Light Initiation pet PvP effective slay/reset does not work on Starlight pets

- **Skill Precedence: Light Initiation Burst Skill** > Super Starlight Ultimate > Extra-dimensional Ultimate > Legendary Ultimate > Super Mystic > **Light Initiation Small Skill** > Starlight Small Skill > Extra-dimensional Small Skill > Legendary Small Skill > Ultimate Transformation Note **Light Initiation different systems have different precedence. For example, Light Ash precedence equals Light Initiation small skill.**
- Note some skills are marked as precedence equal to **Light Initiation Burst Skill, such as Supreme Blessing.**
- Super Fast precedence +1 > Super Fast > Normal
- (1) Ultimate Priority
- Light Initiation Burst Skill precedence +1 > Light Initiation Burst Skill > Super Starlight Ultimate Super Fast > Super Starlight Ultimate > Extra-dimensional Ultimate Super Fast > Extra-dimensional Ultimate > Legendary Ultimate
- (2) Small Skill Priority
- **Light Initiation Precedence Light Energy Skill > Light Initiation Light Energy Skill > Light Initiation Precedence PP Skill > Light Initiation PP Skill** > Starlight Three-Star Precedence > Starlight Three-Star > Starlight Skill > Extra-dimensional Precedence Skill > Extra-dimensional Normal > Postcedence
- (3) **Pet Switching Precedence**
- **Light Initiation Burst > Starlight Burst > Pet Switching > Potion > Small Skill**
- Light Initiation/Starlight/Extra-dimensional/Legendary/Mystic **normal ultimate priority跨era greater than normal small skills For example: Starlight ultimate/Extra-dimensional ultimate/Super Mystic faster than Light Initiation small skill.**

### Damage Resistance: True Resistance vs False Resistance

- **True Resistance: Reduces all damage.** Red direct damage (skill direct damage), purple fixed damage (deduction, absorption, percentage), thus can **reduce yellow total damage. Only [Sin of Lust] Caesar can weaken among pets.**
- **False Resistance: Can only reduce red direct damage. Weakened resistance is false resistance.**
  :::tip
  Single segment red direct damage上限999999 (round to 1 million)
  True resistance increase/decrease can affect damage上限.
  System levels give #resistance boost# generally false resistance; damage reduction is true resistance.
  :::

### Attack Count vs Combo Count Difference

- **Skills attacking multiple times (abbreviated as multi-segment) and combos are different**
- **Multi-segment: One skill can deal ≥2 red direct damage** is multi-segment skill.
- Skill description as **attack target x times/attack count +x.**
- **Combo: After releasing one skill**, **automatically release skill again** is combo, skill description as **combo.**

Main difference is **multi-segment only acts once; combo acts multiple times**, thus when attack target dies, if remaining combo count will chase other targets/switch targets; multi-segment won't.

- **Attack count buffs and combo buffs** are different, thus need to distinguish these two concepts.
- **Example: Demon King Lie's Ten Thousand Demons Multi-slash attack count +[1, 99] Multi-segment**
- **Light Ash Suisuiqi's combo once this skill Combo**
- **Chaos formation team Attack count >5 Multi-segment**
- **Holy Tianyi formation team Combo skill Combo**

## Universal Supports

(All King Exclusive effects, values are上限values, **★ marked are commonly used supports**)

- **Support f4:** Refers to **Empress, Ziya, Dragon King, Black Wing**, 6v1 universal supports, where Empress and Ziya are most important, Dragon King second, all three can be obtained through first charge, can also be obtained with Star Coins. Black Wing relatively less important.

- **Support f4:** Refers to **Empress, Ziya, Dragon King, Black Wing**, 6v1 universal supports, where Empress and Ziya are most important, Dragon King second, all three can be obtained through first charge, can also be obtained with Star Coins. Black Wing relatively less important.
- **1. Eternal Frost Jade - Ice and Snow Empress★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction, attribute lock, attribute boost, crit/crit damage boost, protect attributes**
  Enter field gain **5** light energy, **deduct enemy field 2 light energy**; ultimate sacrifice self **ignore protection single target** weaken **all attributes 6 levels**, **attribute levels cannot提升15 rounds**, **ignore protection weaken 15% stats**, our side **attribute levels提升to highest, crit rate +100%, crit damage +200%, inheritable, 15 rounds.** **Next出场pet** take direct damage -99%, 2 rounds. **1 light skill** protect attribute levels and stats**, **inheritable**, **15 rounds\*\*.

- **Note** very universal, 6v1 and 4v2 both essential, encounter strong attribute reduction open protect attributes. **No need for Brilliant version!**

- **2. Heaven's Mandate - Jiang Ziya★: Self-destruct, stat weakening, stat提升, blood lock**

- **Note:** Often used in 6v1, sometimes in 4v2 can also be used to stand in. Since most Light Initiation bosses heal little, not necessarily self-destruct. Note stats weaken current value, some bosses may have **Star Dream**, after entering提升stats, only Ziya cannot weaken to最低, can carry other weakening pets like Empress, Fire Angel, etc.

- **3. Four Seas Turbulent - Ao Xing★: Self-destruct, damage reduction, attribute reduction, probability化解, light energy refund**
  Enter field gain **6** light energy and **resistance boost 80% 1 round**; ultimate sacrifice self, grant single target **boosted attribute levels round end double reduction 12** rounds, our pets **take direct damage -60%**, **60% immune to attack skills, round end 25% refund this round consumed light energy, damage boost 150%, inheritable, 12 rounds**.

- **Note** generally only used in 6v1, can greatly increase survival ability, light energy refund also very important.

- **4. Shadow Eclipse Moon - Black Wing King★: Self-destruct, damage boost, HP recovery**
- Enter field full light energy** and boost self HP and上限75%, all attributes 60%**; ultimate sacrifice self, grant our side **damage boost 200%, each round first skill use recover 15000 HP, inheritable, 20 rounds**.
- Used in 6v1, most attackers each round自带HP recovery are 15000, when facing high damage bosses can变improve survival ability. Damage boost less, can switch to other supports.

- **Xinuo f4: Sun, Sacred Spirit, Dragon and Wood four Xinuo** functions equivalent to Empress, Ziya, Dragon King and Black Wing, but if attacker not Xinuo family pet, provided boost only 75% effect, when attacker stats high or boss stats low is completely sufficient. Need all four together, otherwise boost will be less.
- **5. Sun Miracle - Sun Xinuo★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction, attribute lock, attribute boost, crit/crit damage boost, protect attributes**
  Enter field gain **5** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self **ignore protection single target** weaken **all attributes 6 levels**, **attribute levels cannot提升12/8 rounds**, our side **attribute levels +6/4, crit rate +100%/75%, crit damage +200%/150%, inheritable, 15 rounds.** **Next出场pet** take direct damage -99%/75%, 2 rounds. **Small skill** 100%/75% protect attribute levels and stats**, **inheritable**, **15 rounds\*\*.

  Enter field gain **5** light energy and **resistance boost 80% 1 round**; ultimate sacrifice self, our pets **take direct damage -60%/45%**, **60%/30% immune to attack skills, round end 25%/18.75% refund this round consumed light energy, damage boost 150%/112.5%, inheritable, 12 rounds**.

- **9. Heaven and Earth Compete With Me Free - Xiaoyao: Self-destruct,化解, ability禁锢, extra light energy**
- **Use new skill group.** Enter field gain **4** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self, grant **enemy stats cannot提升5/7 rounds**; leave field (death/switch both) grant **next出场pet 150%化解(2+enemy count/2, round down)次attack skills 3 rounds, cooldown 4 rounds, each round not take damage extra gain 1 light 5 rounds.**
- **Note** boss if has accuracy buff, may ignore our side化解, Xiaoyao provided 150%化解rate generally not ignored. Used less, when facing very high damage special pets or配合fixed damage Pandora use.

- **10. Illusion Sea Miracle - Water Xinuo: Self-destruct,化解, ability禁锢, extra light energy**
  Enter field gain **4** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self, grant **enemy stats cannot提升5/7 rounds**;退场after (death/switch both) grant **next出场pet 100%/75%化解(2+enemy count/2, round down)次attack skills 5 rounds, each round not take damage 100%/60% extra gain 1 light 5 rounds.**

- **11. Constellation Feather★**: **Non-self-destruct, same系our side pet restraint multiplier, Special Attack/Normal Attack stat boost**
- **Click Constellation Blessing after use**，**see 3.2 for details**

- **Recommendation** Prioritize obtaining those with free exclusive. Next Dice King is Divine Weapon, Contract Pet release ultimate即可damage boost, can bind to Empress. Since self-destruct Version Child pets include all系, subsequent Version Child pets are Extra-dimensional pets that can be freely obtained through monthly dungeons (entrance: Challenge Trials → Time Dungeons).
- **Note** Otherworld and King Exclusive can both enter field self-destruct, generally self-destruct before Black Wing, otherwise Black Wing's HP recovery will make Version Child immortal. Version Child damage boost gets diluted, effect far不如Constellation, generally used less in challenges, only when lacking damage or Fantasy Epic etc. 6v1封pet challenges.

- **13**.**Dust Creation Star God - Star Dust**: **Self-destruct, attribute lock, extra light energy, power boost**
- Enter field gain **6** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self, **next出场** pet **each round extra gain 4 light 5 rounds**, **skill power boost consume light energy count 50%, highest 200%**, **10** rounds.

- **Each attack for target** add **1** layer **Crimson Moon Mark 20 rounds**, **each layer reduce 10% resistance,上限5 layers, most reduce to 0%, resistance 0% take damage increase 100%**. 2 light grant target **light energy flow (each round end deduct 1 light energy, duration X rounds, X as Crimson Moon Mark layers**). Leave field enemy field **automatically use one 2 light skill**. Fast stack marks can use **Secret Technique Flying Sword (attack HP ratio比self higher pets can combo once), ultimate必定attack twice**.
- **Note** rarely used, only when boss自带damage resistance useful, can配合Binding Master Odin, but rarely used.

- **15. Sweet Messenger - Fool: Self-destruct, single segment damage boost**
- Enter field gain **5** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self, make enemy **each round take** **highest single segment damage附带60% fixed damage, **上限**600k, 8 rounds.**
- **Note** early support, rarely used, rare employment is配合first gen Yeying/Pandora use.

- **17. Time Sound弥漫·Luo Xi: Self-destruct, damage boost (Starlight pets)**
- Enter field **5** stars, ultimate sacrifice self, make **our pets each round damage +20%,上限200%, inheritable, infinite rounds**
- **Note** early support, due to结算issues and need to develop, is Black Wing King's inferior替代.

- **18. Dreamy Splendid Night - Xihe: Non-self-destruct, lifesteal, crit damage (Starlight pets)**
- Enter field give enemy add Dreamy Mark, attack带Mark target **lifesteal +100%**, **crit damage +50%**, **infinite rounds**
- **Note** early support, suitable for high damage targets ensure续航, can also配合Du use.

- **Following support effects related to our field pet count, =2时max (red numbers), =1时blue numbers**
- **19. All Under Heaven Bow - Empress★: Self-destruct, attribute reduction weakening, Special Attack pet damage boost**
- Enter field **full** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self, **weaken enemy field 6 levels all attributes, weaken (all attribute stats reduce 50%/25%) 10 rounds; our side gain Special Attack skill damage boost 200%/100%, inheritable, 10 rounds; next pet immediately gain 4 light energy.**
- **Note:** 4v2 **Special Attack** pet **universal** support, and free King Exclusive. Enter field will **deduct self 20% HP**, thus **cannot trigger chain soul weapon**. Black Wing King Blessing/**Source Card** can make其self-destruct后not die.

- **Note:** 4v2 **Special Attack** pet **universal** support. Mengpo and Empress which damage higher, depends on your output if has自带crit damage. If output自带much crit damage, use Empress, vice versa Mengpo.
- **Dual weakening打法**: Can through **soul weapon carry chain** achieve **self-destruct** not die. Since chain blood lock 1 round,配合Heal Card round end heal, can second round switch down, wait for weakening and crit damage boost end switch stand-in support up, through凹enemy not attack Mengpo, achieve **again self-destruct**, equivalent to **extend buff rounds**, need luck but can effectively increase damage, when configuration really insufficient can consider this打法.

- **21. Sacred Flame Seraphim - Sera★: Self-destruct, weakening, Normal Attack pet crit damage boost**
- Enter field **full** light energy; ultimate sacrifice self, **weaken enemy field 6 levels all attributes, weaken (all attribute stats reduce 50%/25%) 10 rounds; our side gain Normal Attack skill crit damage boost 200%/100%, inheritable, 10 rounds; next pet immediately gain 4 light energy.**

- **22. Nameless Beginning Realm - Alaya-vijnana★: Non-self-destruct, attribute boost, Special Attack pet crit rate boost, power boost**
- **Ultimate release immediately return to backpack**, grant teammates **take attack use exclusive skill counter once**, **Special Attack skill crit rate boost 100%/50%, power boost 150%/75%**, **inheritable, 10 rounds;** first leave field **grant** **our side all 6 levels all attribute levels (only包括currently field pets and switch pets, not inheritable)**.
- **Note:** 4v2 **Special Attack** pet **universal** support, and free King Exclusive. Same提升crit rate and attribute levels, but generally **effect不如Ice and Snow Empress**, unless梵Tian team such as **dual Special Attack c** formation, but梵Tian team also has superior替代. Another advantage can **boost stand-in support levels**, increase survival ability. Additionally, can in 6v1 be pulled by Abys as stand-in pet, ultimate can套counter increase output.

- **23. Moon Shadow Night澜- Yeying★: Non-self-destruct, attribute boost, Normal Attack pet crit rate boost, power boost**
- **Ultimate release immediately return to backpack**, **dispel对方2个latest获得且rounds ＜10的boost effects**, grant teammates **Normal Attack skill crit rate boost 100%/50%, power boost 150%/75%**, **inheritable, 10 rounds;** first leave field **grant** **our side all 6 levels all attribute levels (only包括currently field pets and switch pets, not inheritable)**. Small skill can grant target **2** times **take damage increase 40%**, **3** rounds.
- **Note:** 4v2 **Normal Attack** pet **universal** support, generally **effect不如Ice and Snow Empress**, used relatively less, generally for stand-in support very容易be directly killed by damage Normal Attack formations or Normal Attack dual c formations.

## Constellation Feather (Support)

Constellation Feather pets abbreviated as **Constellation**, are very important supports, commonly used in both 6v1 and 4v2.

![](/aola/pet-dictionary_069.png) Pets with this system icon are Constellation Feather pets, sometimes also called **Meteor Children**.

- **Constellation function:**对抗**Constellation系restraint** enemies, using Constellation support **same系** attackers can gain powerful **restraint multiplier and stat boost**, damage boost effect very obvious.
- **Constellation points: Click system Obtain Starlight**, each Constellation pet **body** and **equipped King Exclusive each** count as one starlight count (Otherworld cannot). Each starlight count needs consume **100 system enhancement stones** to obtain. ![](/aola/pet-dictionary_070.png)

- **Constellation use**: Constellation首发时no level limit, non-首发时need full level, **click Constellation Feather** icon to gain Constellation blessing. Constellation skill release **precedence** depends on this round operation, generally potion/switch pet.
- **Constellation blessing: 10/15** rounds, gain Constellation Feather系all boosts, **inheritable** to **next** same系pet.
- **Note**: Constellation use后switch pet **different系from Constellation**, then switch to same系pet, Constellation blessing still can inherit (example: Sacred Spirit → King → Sacred Spirit still can inherit blessing) and中途not calculate rounds.
- If switch to **same系** pet eat Constellation blessing之后, **again switch** will make Constellation blessing disappear.
- (Example: Dragon Chant Guard → Dragon King → 1314, 1314 cannot eat Constellation blessing)
- Constellation blessing only for **self and self switch** to pet, not field-wide, especially note in 4v2. Abys pull Constellation stand-in前don't forget open Constellation blessing;
- Rented Constellation points use **own** Constellation points. Pet **gain Constellation blessing**后, switch attributes (like Du, Star Dragon transform, Mi Pan switch god form) still can continue use blessing.
