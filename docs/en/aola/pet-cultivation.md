# Pet Cultivation

Insufficient pet damage is likely due to poor cultivation. Soul cards and soul weapons are very important, and crystal keys also provide certain improvements.

## New Skill Group vs Old Skill Group

Strictly speaking, this section is not actually part of pet cultivation content. However, due to its importance and relevance to cultivation, it is placed in this chapter.

Comparison between new skill group and old skill group pets:

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_021.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_022.png)
Simply put, pets from the first year of Light Initiation are all old skill group, and the new skill group was created for 4v2 battles. It's very easy to distinguish between new and old skill group pets. Old skill group pets generally have 1 PP skill, 1 one-light skill, and 1 two-light skill; new skill group pets can change skills through skill configuration (this function is generally used in PvP).

:::warning
**Only new skill group pets can equip soul weapons and crystal keys.**
:::

- Pets released in early 2024 and later no longer have old skill groups. Planners promised to give all old skill group pets new skill groups, but currently only some old skill group pets can switch to new skill groups.
  ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_023.jpg)

For example, support Black Wing, the button in the upper right corner can switch between old and new skill groups. It's worth noting that for these old pets with new skill groups, the King Exclusive has both old and new skill group effects.
:::warning
**Otherworld equipment only works for new skill group**

This section also reveals the answer to why both Black Wings cannot self-destruct on the field: using the new skill group or wearing Otherworld equipment, not entering the field with full light.
:::
![](/aola/pet-cultivation_024.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_025.png)

:::tip
Due to soul weapon and crystal key enhancements. **Old skill group pets need to reach a certain combat effectiveness to max out skills.**
:::

## Level

Must be maxed out.

## Talent

Best to max out, even with limited resources, at least enhance corresponding Normal Attack/Special Attack after reaching "Only I Am Supreme".

## Nature

The increased attribute should be the corresponding Normal Attack/Special Attack. Speed-boosting natures are recommended for attacks, and reducing opposing attack natures also achieve full battle effectiveness.

## Equipment

PvE pets basically all require **exclusive equipment,** except for annual fee and secret treasure pets, which are purchased in the **equipment shop**.

Old skill group pets only have King Equipment (abbreviated as King Excl); currently most new skill group pets used in PvE have both **King Equipment** and **Otherworld Equipment**.

Otherworld is an inferior alternative to King Excl, providing the same effects but with lower values, and some effects may become 75% chance to trigger.

Comparison example (upper for King Excl, lower for Otherworld)

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_026.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_027.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_028.png)
Ideally, of course, we want all pets to have King Excl. However, free acquisition of King Excl is limited monthly. Here are the priority levels for King Excl:

- **T0**: **Key commonly used universal supports** e.g.: Empress, Ziya, Empress, Alai, Fire Angel, Mengpo, etc. must have King Excl. Empress and Ziya don't have Otherworld. Empress and Alai's King Excl are given to new players, Fire Angel's King Excl is obtained through Master King, Mengpo's can be obtained through bundle purchase. If weakening-type pets only have Otherworld, it greatly affects damage.
- **T1**: **Commonly used formation main DPS** e.g.: Evoker, Hero Qiling King, Divine Xihe, etc. Formation pets are used frequently, highly recommended to cultivate first. Evoker has very high stats, Otherworld can make do temporarily, but King Excl is ultimately better; facing recent stat inflation, older formations struggle, if used must have King Excl.
  :::tip
  **Ameng King and Hero Uncrowned's** King Excl are free! Don't exchange without checking carefully, will lose King Diamonds
  :::

- **T2**: **Light Ash commonly used attackers** e.g.: Eileen, Suisuiqi, etc. Suisuiqi and other older commonly used Light Ash basically must have King Excl, newer attackers like Mi Pan and Zhaojun can use Otherworld temporarily.
  :::tip
  For commonly used Light Ash, Suisuiqi and Freya's King Excl can be freely exchanged in the fleet! Given to new players in 1314!
  :::

- **T3**: **Other formation supports, Supreme Glory** e.g.: Star Ring Master, Ace Team, Third Gen Monkey, etc. Star Ring Master without King Excl will have one less star, Ace Team and Monkey are more specialized, can use Fire Tian as substitute temporarily. Supreme Glory recommended to cultivate after commonly used formations, slowly supplement through free activities, can replace part of formation team.
- **T4**: Version Child, Light Initiation God Weapon, Constellation Feather **e.g.**: God Weapon Luo Xi, Chunjun, etc. Supplement as opportunity arises, not recommended to specifically exchange. Version Child except Fantasy Epic basically not usable. Some God Weapon pets can be obtained for free through activities or Master King exchange, Constellation King Excl can be slowly exchanged through Domain.
- **T5**: Formation team stand-in supports **e.g.**: Luo Xi (Xihe team), Mad Dragon (Immortal Dragon team). Employment has almost been replaced by Constellation. Give Otherworld set to make do when Constellation points are very few early on, no need to cultivate later.
- **Special**: **Annual Fee Du, Abys, Universe Secret Treasure** have no Otherworld, must have King Exclusive, don't equip Lazy Set anymore

:::tip
Can Hundred Star Set, Sakura Set, etc. still be used? Currently not usable in most PvE situations, Health Talisman can be given to pets needing high HP and no King Excl, such as Tower King, Extra-dimensional Seimei.

Extra-dimensional equipment, Starlight equipment, etc. even if can be equipped on Light Initiation pets have no effect.

Mixing Otherworld/King Excl cannot trigger effects, cannot have two King Excl and two Otherworld pieces.

## Soul Cards

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_029.png)

- **Soul Card Effects**
- **Soul Card Entries**
- **Entry Growth Value**
- **Effective Soul Seat**
- **Soul Card Effects** Main effect of a soul card, the circle is the effect name, full name Circle Moon, generally one character abbreviation is used, the crit rate boost below is the specific effect.
- **Soul Card Entries:** Entries are divided into Normal Attack, Special Attack, etc. Normal Attack is **orange**, Special Attack is **blue**, Dual Attack is **white**
- **Entry Growth Value** Numbers attached to entries, calculated through the +x addition
- **Effective Soul Seat:** Soul card entries and entry growth values reach the required **soul seat class** to take effect, meaning soul cards on level 5 soul seat **from top to bottom** first five take effect, level 3 soul seat first three take effect, level 1 soul seat only first takes effect. Soul seats start at level 1 and need soul sand to upgrade.
  ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_030.png)

- **Current Growth Value**
- **Current Entry**
- **Current Entry**: Level 1 1/20 Level 2 5/20 Level 3 10/20 Level 4 15/20 Level 5 20/20
- **Boost only related to level**, 14/20 only counts as level 3, similarly 20, 21, 22 have same effect
- **Current Growth Value:** Obtained by **adding effective soul card growth values**
- **Free cards obtained through soul card wish. Returning players** and **new players** can set wish according to this **wishlist**:
  ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_031.png)

- **Xinuoma and Little Xinuo** are **Chant Card and Year Card** respectively, output main cards, placed in level 5 soul seat, effect is Normal/Special Attack stat +10; Power +[20+target HP limit/5000]1%, limit=60%
- **Hermes and Erebos** cards are for stacking Special Attack/Normal Attack and Dual Attack respectively, placed in level 3 soul seat, can be replaced with **Zhaolie Emperor/ Genghis Khan**, same effect.
- **Far right** is **Awareness Card**, effect: Pet carrying this soul card **dies** and our side gains 50% all skill damage boost for 8 rounds, same type effect only triggers once (give to last self-destruct pet). Multiple Awareness Cards can refresh rounds. **When resources tight**, **self-destruct pets** only need to upgrade **level 5 soul seat** to carry **Awareness** card
- **Soul Card Combination:**
  :::tip
  **Don't use system recommended soul cards, or full battle gifts! Not useful!!!!**
  :::

- **Free card** main DPS **PVE** card combination generally **Year/Chant Card 20 Attack 11 Dual Attack**, as shown in Figure 1:
- **Figure 2** is **Special Attack** Year Card: 20 Special Attack 11 Dual Attack; right figure is **Normal Attack** Chant Card: **20 Normal Attack 11 Dual Attack**
  :::tip
  **Note: Circle Card damage slightly lower than Year/Chant Card, also needs 20 Attack 11 Attack combination, other cards not recommended.** Cards with **Circle** entry have multiple types, please look for Dual Attack entries with Xiaoyao/Fantian, Crit Damage entries are secondary cards.
  :::

- **Three-star position** place **Special Attack/Normal Attack + Dual Attack + Special Attack/Normal Attack** cards; **One-star position** place **Special Attack/Normal Attack** cards
  :::tip
  **Paid cards' damage obviously higher than free cards, if able recommend purchase one each of Normal Attack and Special Attack. Not recommended to buy directly, can obtain through soul card treasure hunt/soul card group buy events.**
  :::
  ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_032.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_033.png)

- **Most versatile** **Special Attack** paid card in **PvE** is **Dust Card** (Leisurely Watching Courtyard Flowers Bloom and Fade - Du)
- **Flower Card** (Spring and Blooms - Supreme Apsu) and **Music Card** (Happy Music) have higher stats, but versatility is not as good as Dust Card, mostly **inferior alternatives** to Dust Card, often used for stat-stacking support pets (like Du's seasonal fee, Angel Covenant's kk and Laituo Ruoxi, etc.), not recommended to specifically purchase. **Soul Card Combination** as follows:
- **Figure 1** is **Special Attack** Dust Card: 20 **Special Attack** 15 **Dual Attack** (Three-star position Special Attack + Dual Attack + Special Attack, one-star position Dual Attack; or three-star position Dual Attack + Special Attack + Dual Attack, one-star position Special Attack) Higher limit damage
- **Figure 2** is **Special Attack** Dust Card: 20 **Special Attack** 10 **Crit** 5 **Dual Attack** (Three-star position Special Attack + Crit + Special Attack, one-star position Crit; or three-star position Crit + Special Attack + Crit, one-star position Special Attack) Relatively more stable
- **Figure 3** is **Special Attack** Flower Card: 20 **Crit Damage** 10 **Special Attack** 2 **Crit** (Three-star position Special Attack + Crit Damage + Special Attack, one-star position Crit Damage; or three-star position Crit Damage + Special Attack + Crit Damage, one-star position Special Attack)
- Flower Card entries don't include Special Attack, hard to stack 20 Special Attack. If have Twelve Palaces +3 **Special Attack** card, can stack **15** Special Attack **16** Crit Damage 5 Crit.
- **Figure 4** is **Special Attack** Music Card: 20 **Special Attack** 7 **Crit Damage** 2 **Attack** (Three-star position Special Attack + Dual Attack + Special Attack, one-star position Special Attack)

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_034.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_035.png)
![](/aola/pet-cultivation_036.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_037.png)

- **Most versatile** **Normal Attack** paid card in **PvE** currently is **Response Card** (Mountain and Sea Chronicles - Supreme Apsu)
- **Promise Card** (Promise of a Lifetime) mostly inferior alternative to Response Card, damage higher than free cards, but not recommended to specifically purchase.
- **Soul Card Combination** as follows (specific combinations same as Special Attack, no longer given):
- **Figure 1** is **Normal Attack** Response Card: 20 **Normal Attack** 15 **Attack Limit damage higher**
- **Figure 2** is **Normal Attack** Response Card: 20 **Normal Attack** 15 **Crit** 5 **Attack More stable**
- **Figure 3** is **Normal Attack** Promise Card: 20 **Normal Attack** 13 **Crit Damage** (can be 20 Normal Attack 15 Crit Damage, need **Twelve Palaces card**)
- **Figure 4** is **Normal Attack** Promise Card: 20 **Normal Attack** 7 **Crit Damage** 6 **Crit**

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_038.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_039.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_040.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_041.png)

- **Free soul cards** used by **stand-in supports** include **Iron/Guard/Bless/Wish**, can enhance survivability, generally paired with boss corresponding defense, prioritize stacking **20** HP (stacking **15** is fine), recommended to wish after output cards sufficient. Moderately draw cards with HP + any attribute + HP entries to stack entries. Pairing is relatively casual, examples as follows:
- **Figure 1** is Special Defense **Iron** Card, can boost teammates' **Special Defense** (wish Ming Wang/Cao Cao card; Normal Defense wish Wushan Goddess)
- **Figure 2** is Special Attack **Guard** Card, boosts attributes at round end (wish Mo Xia card; Normal Attack wish Void Dragon Spirit)
- **Figure 3** is Normal Defense **Heal** Card. Recovers HP each round (wish Unknown Shadow, superior paid card is Dragon Mother)
- **Figure 4** is Special Attack **Wish** Card. Boosts HP limit (wish Poor Little Evil; Normal Attack wish Vow Under Starry Sky)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_042.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_043.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_044.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_045.png)

- **Paid soul cards** used by **stand-in supports** include **Wall Card** (Enchanting Gaze Into Red Dust - Bohan) boosts teammates' dual defense and **crit rate; Secret Card** (Time Domain Secret - Supreme Qiling King) boosts teammates' power. Based on versatility and ease of acquisition, **Wall Card** more recommended. These two cards can also be used in PvP, for convenience stack **20** speed **15** defense.
  **![](/aola/pet-cultivation_046.png)**

For improved stand-in ability can choose **Dragon Card** (Mastering Causality Through Eternity - Di Jun), reduces damage taken in first four rounds and **Source** Card (Breaking Void, Ten Thousand Dragons - Dragon Mother) heals at round end. Secondary card paired with boss corresponding defense and HP, can also share set with PvP, stack **20** speed.

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_047.png)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_048.png)
Additionally **Ring** Card can be used for multi-hit Special Attack pets. **Attack count ≥ 4** damage higher than Dust Card (like Fafnir, Moon Xinuo, Chaos, etc.). Pairing is **20** Special Attack **10** Crit Damage **5** HP.

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_049.png)

:::tip
**Personal recommendation priority: Dust equals Response (each has two best) greater than Wall greater than Ring others** Paid soul cards not essential, but relatively higher priority in Star Coin purchases.
:::

Soul cards can be freely removed, for convenience can be saved as presets. After configuration click Add to Preset. Next use click Soul Card Scheme - My Presets - Use Preset. If you own the soul card, even if equipped on other pets, system can automatically detect and use, very convenient.

If too lazy to configure soul cards, can use smart assembly function, pairing PvE soul cards no problem.

:::tip
**Before cultivating system-given soul cards, must remove originally equipped soul cards!!!**
:::

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_050.png)

If hope a pet's soul cards won't be automatically removed by system, click small lock in top left. Of course **not recommended to click this lock, soul cards relatively scarce early on.**

## Soul Weapons

:::warning
Only **new skill group** pets can equip soul weapons!!!
:::
Soul weapons are divided into **Technique Type** soul weapons and **Power Type** soul weapons. **Technique Type** soul weapons provide soul weapon effects, Power Type **soul weapons** provide stats.

**Epic** quality is stronger than Legendary.

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_051.png)

- **Soul Weapon Effects**
- **Effect Conditions**
- **Soul Weapon Entries**

- **Effect Conditions:** Only **before entering battle** meeting effect trigger stats will trigger soul weapon effects
- **Soul Weapon Entries:** Obtained through **refinement**, improve stats.
- **Soul Weapon Effects** Meeting effect conditions and entering game grants soul weapon effects
  :::tip
  **Note**: **Soul Baptism** don't use recklessly, don't wash **useless epic soul weapons**, **even more don't wash crit/crit damage/penetration for PvE. Please focus on Normal Attack/Special Attack.**
  :::

In **PvE**, we generally wash soul weapons for **Normal Attack** or **Special Attack** entries.

Generally **two Special Attack fish + two Normal Attack fish + two Special Attack books + two Normal Attack flowers** sufficient for most situations. New player tasks give most of these, wash slowly. **Don't wash axes early on, don't equip axes!**

- **Technique Type Soul Weapons** recommended: **Never Give Up Lazy Fish (preferred), Adaptive Offensive Module (preferred), Domain-exchanged Light Slash (for combos), Subsequent Choice and Cat Alert Doll (for counterattacks)**, all for main DPS. As shown:

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_052.jpg)**![](/aola/pet-cultivation_053.jpg)**

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_054.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_055.png)

**![](/aola/pet-cultivation_056.png)**

- **Power Type Soul Weapons** recommended: **Fountain of Life** (Normal Attack), **Paladin Chronicles** (Special Attack), as shown: ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_057.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_058.jpg)
- Other **PvE** possibly useful technique soul weapons:
- **Weathered Chains:** Can make Mengpo/Fire Angel **not die** on self-destruct round, making **Constellation** formation start faster, special levels in conjunction with Heal Card can achieve **second self-destruct**, extend buff rounds. Highly recommended.
- **Fire Stealer's Covenant** (Domain exchange): On death gives next pet **60%** power boost for **3** rounds
- **Witch's Eternal Garden** provides teammates **24** damage boost
- **Sage's Counterattack**: **Switching in** when attacked clears enemy buffs, targets Longmu/Beiliya, etc.
- **Light of the World**: Causes **fixed damage** increase 30%, currently only for **fixed damage Du**.
- **Newborn's Echo, Tree Fruit**: Healing, improves support survivability
  ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_059.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_060.png)

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_061.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_062.png)

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_063.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_064.jpg)

- **Immortal Medal** When entering field **75** immunity to one non-restraint damage, can protect supports
- **Companion's Resonance**: When teammates use **same attribute skills as self** boost **30** damage
  ![](/aola/pet-cultivation_065.jpg)![](/aola/pet-cultivation_066.png)

- **Soul Weapon Inheritance System** usage conditions:
- **1**. Can only transfer **Legendary** soul weapon entries to **Epic** soul weapons, cannot transfer between Epic soul weapons, Legendary soul weapons either.
- **2**. Can only transfer **Technique Type** soul weapons to **Technique Type** soul weapons, **Power Type** soul weapons to **Power Type** soul weapons.
- **3**. When transferring **Legendary** soul weapon to **Epic** soul weapon, Epic soul weapon **must be unrefined**
  :::tip
  **Never get obsessed** with refining soul weapons, new players don't pursue perfect 8 Attack soul weapons, only need technique + power type combined to have **5-6** needed entries, obsession leads to nothing.
  :::

:::warning
Releasing Light Ash also counts as one coffin skill used
:::

:::tip
Releasing Light Ash also subject to **Axe** and **Dark Spell** restriction of only using one skill, generally don't give these to DPS in PvE unless your DPS only deals damage through ultimate. Axe priority determination is very high, Hero Skills, System Skills, etc. all count as one skill, not recommended to use.
:::

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_067.png)

- **Soul weapons also have preset function**, mouse over top right current configuration to use.

## Crystal Keys

:::warning
Only **new skill group** pets can equip crystal keys!!!
:::

Crystal keys can provide stat boosts (not shown on panel) and damage boosts **after entering battle**.

Each pet can equip two crystal keys, some crystal keys can be duplicated. Once equipped, crystal keys bind to that pet, cannot be equipped to other pets. Two identical pets' crystal keys can be shared. Additionally, pets and their Brilliant versions, Star Ring Master before/after coronation (8.8 update) can also share.

![](/aola/pet-cultivation_068.png)

Pets released before December 16, 2024 come with recommended crystal keys. Pets released after need manual equipping. However, like soul card recommendations, system recommendations are not the best.

Best crystal key combination for output: **Assault Key (Normal Attack +10%)/Psychic Key (Special Attack +10%) + Resonance Key (same-type skill final damage increase 12%)**

However, crystal key acquisition is also limited, **not all pets need limit damage setup**. Generally just give two with 6% corresponding attack, for high-stat attackers can even skip crystal keys. Generally recommended for very commonly used attackers, or when really lacking damage, then consider equipping best crystal keys.

New skill group supports, like Empress, Mengpo, Fire Angel, Constellation, etc. can equip **Power Key (all backpack pets Normal Attack +3%)/Wisdom Key (all backpack pets Special Attack +3%), more effects the better, as icing on the cake** these crystal keys no need to waste selectable crystal keys, random crystal keys obtain as luck allows.
