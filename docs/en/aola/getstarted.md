High frame rate can make the game much smoother, but don't turn on acceleration at the same time - one is enough.

Sometimes strange time-related issues occur, such as being restricted by anti-addiction before online time is reached, or arena closing before time is up, etc. This may be caused by acceleration. Just refresh with F5.

Graphics quality and window size can also be adjusted here.

## Main Interface Introduction

As a web game, Aola Star's main interface is quite dazzling. Let's break it down for explanation.

### Free Stuff Section

Free stuff that might give pets, King exclusives, resources, etc. Just click them one by one.

![](/aola/getstarted_011.png)

Summoning Array - Most pets **can be challenged**, recommended to exchange for **Constellation pets**. Can be used for Pokedex later.

Remember to do the monthly God Coupon Challenge - very simple, can farm pet selection of the month. Choosing a difficult-to-get pet or replicant is very worthwhile.

### Latest Activities

![](/aola/getstarted_012.png)

Pay attention to theme activities, often can farm some resources for free.

If you have money to spend or accumulated many Star Coins, you can also check special offers, which might have Soul Card Treasures, Soul Group Buys, Diamond Equipment Bundles, or Special Sale Events, etc.

### Pet Cultivation

Daily resource acquisition, the top row is very important, the bottom row is mostly free.

![](/aola/getstarted_014.png)**Must do**, can get various resources, Secret Treasure Crystals, Meteor Fragments, farm Seraphim for free, some God Weapon pets and exclusives.
::: tip

### PvE Section

![](/aola/getstarted_015.png)![](/aola/getstarted_016.png)
**New players must do - just fight through them one by one**

![](/aola/getstarted_017.png)
Quick access - most challenges are here.

![](/aola/getstarted_018.png)

- **Otherworld Fantasy** mainly obtains refinement materials (flowers and grasses) for Soul Weapons, also has Soul Card resources. Low stats, most levels can be cleared with Xinuo. For levels that reflect 50k damage, bring Giant Form summoner; for 20% damage reflection, use缔界Xinuoma.
- **Domain Descent** can obtain Constellation pet bodies and their King exclusives, limited Soul Weapons and cute skins, and Light Initiation pet collections. **Current week's Domain has extra rewards**. Small levels are very simple, can be cleared casually; if really can't, can use Master Coins to pass. Big levels usually feature the current month's promoted formation + an old formation, new players can try their luck. Note that big levels have two sections that lock pets - if you use a pet in one section and clear it, you can't use it in the other.
- **Myth Trial** updates monthly. Can obtain Meteor Fragments, some miscellaneous rewards, and Twelve Palaces limited Soul Cards. The biggest value is +3 Normal Attack/Special Attack/Dual Attack for building entry combinations. Palace Master Battle can be skipped, solo levels are very simple, just choose克制ones. Remember to get more free cultivation pets.
- **Time Dungeons** can obtain current month's Version Child pets and their King exclusives, generally not difficult, but the given pets are for collection or entertainment only. Also gives some miscellaneous resources. Cumulative progress rewards can farm full battle reincarnation team for free.
- **Fantasy Epic**: High-difficulty challenge, not recommended for early stages. If you can clear it, your PvE level is pretty good. Don't worry if you don't have many female皇子牙, there are usually casual strategies, but still need to cultivate many pets and require some luck. About once every three months, can obtain a full set of random King exclusives. After 40 random attempts, can choose.
- **Challenge Archives** almost includes all challenge pets, just fight backwards from the end.
  ![](/aola/getstarted_019.png)

- **Kevin Island** gives summoning coupons. Can get rewards just by clearing, passing is enough. Most Physical Islands can use Evoked Holy Tianyi to push through, Magic Islands can use Evoked Xinuoma to push through. Later may need many克制attackers or even Secret Treasures.
- **Valley of Despair** except Silent Soul Tower are all simple, but rewards are also few, only consider if bored. Silent Soul Tower is very difficult, requires high Constellation points, absolute克制attackers and luck.
- **New Peak Tower** rewards are average, but very tricky. Starlight pets inside are considered PvP units and have type restrictions. Need many old skill group pets and exclusives, not recommended for early stages.
- **Old Peak Tower** gives considerable experience and Soul Sand, low difficulty, can fight when resources are scarce.
  ::: tip
  **Kevin Island**, **Valley of Despair Otherworld Fantasy**, and **New Peak Tower** stamina recovers daily.

  **Domain** updates weekly, removes the month before last each month, recommended to **fight weekly**.

  **Meteor Twelve Palaces** also update monthly, remember to fight.

## PvP Section

::: danger
Apprentice first before fighting, otherwise can't apprentice and lose badly
:::

- There may be players who don't like PvP or think it's too money-burning. However, PvP can produce a certain amount of **Star Coins** and important resources like King Diamonds. Don't worry, there are system formations and casual formations that can reach high ranks, and My has scripts for AFK farming. ![](/aola/getstarted_020.png)

- **Otherworld Double Pets** is currently the most mainstream and easiest to start with PvP. There will be a dedicated chapter later.
- **Multi-Pet Battle**: Fewer players, relatively fixed strategies. Depends on Secret Treasures and annual fees, needs some old pets.
- **Wild Brawl** needs Extra-dimensional and Starlight pets and exclusives, with luck factor.
- **Otherworld Double Pets** and **Multi-Pet settle monthly based on highest rank of the two, **Wild Brawl\*\* settles quarterly separately.

## Social Section

### Friends

- New/returning players can borrow friends' pets, cherish the opportunity and use frequently.

### Master-Apprentice

- Can borrow master's pets, and is calculated separately from friend rentals, must find a reliable and communicative master to apprentice. Additionally, Master-Apprentice Shop can exchange for large amounts of Soul Sand and other resources that newcomers lack. Notably, **can't apprentice after reaching Gold rank**, must apprentice first!

### Fleet

- Planner-promoted guild-like social. Weekly activities can produce Soul Baptism and some King Diamonds, Fleet Shop can exchange for some Light Ash pet King exclusives, very useful. Therefore, best to join a relatively high-level fleet, don't just click one-click application and join randomly, especially Launch Fleet, some activities don't even exist.

### Team

- Obsolete guild-like social, but can exchange for useful items like Gold Equipment, King Advancement Star Energy, Skill Reset Cards, Starlight pets and skin summoning coupons. Weekly can also get some Meteor Fragments by luck. **Team Tian Gong Tree and Fleet Technology share Team Contribution, easier to obtain and recommended to level Boss Killer for PvE damage**. Most activities have scripts.

### Corps

- Small squad social, few people few activities, can exchange for some resources including Character Refinement Cards, Starlight Skin Summoning Coupons, etc., still recommended to join one.

## PvE Introduction

- **Early Game Opening** The main gameplay of the game is **PvE**, through challenges, mini-games, and Summoning Arrays, you can get **most pets for free**. Light Initiation era challenges are quite **formulaic**, mainly divided into 6v1 and 4v2 types. The core is to **weaken enemy attributes with support pets applying debuffs while applying buffs to our side, then switch to克制attackers for output**. Generally, as long as your setup and technique are adequate, most challenges are not difficult.
- Several important points when challenging:
- **Attribute Levels**: Mouse over pet to view. Ensure enemy attribute level is -6, our attribute level is +6. Changed attribute levels are one reason for abnormal damage. 6v1 generally uses **Ice and Snow Empress** or **Sun Xinuo** to weaken enemy attributes, preventing their attribute increase while increasing our attributes. For bosses with strong attribute weakening abilities, need to protect our attributes with small skills.
- **Stat Values** Light Initiation bosses' stats can be reduced to a minimum of **50%** of **on-field value**. Generally 6v1 uses Jiang Ziya or Sacred Spirit Xinuo to weaken enemy stats while increasing our stats, 4v2 generally uses Empress, Mengpo and Fire Angel, Ace Team for weakening, reducing boss attributes.
- **Critical Hits** Light Initiation bosses have 50% **critical resistance**, understood as halving pet critical rate. Therefore, the 100% crit provided by Ice and Snow Empress/Sun Xinuo is not guaranteed crit, sometimes need **Soul Cards** for further increase, or **multiple attempts**. Additionally, supports like Alai, Yeying, Monkey, Suisuiqi can also provide crit rate, often used in 4v2.
- **Damage Boost/Power Blessing/Crit Damage Increase** Literal meaning, all increase damage. Many methods provide these boosts. Besides support self-destructs, also pet innate abilities, out-of-battle factors, etc. Note that similar boosts dilute each other, so ensure your pets have buffs from different categories.
- **Restraint Multiplier** Since restraint multiplier sources are few, rarely diluted, thus greatly increases damage, almost always used. Currently mainly provided by Constellation Feather pets, stand-in supports and Star Ring Masters. Additionally,缔界师can also provide, some attackers have innate restraint multipliers. Skills attacking dual-type enemy units add restraint multipliers.
- Additionally, must pay attention to **round counts** of various buffs, Light Initiation buffs mostly last around 10 rounds, when your buffs disappear damage drops sharply and then get killed by boss.

:::tip
New skill group attackers generally have many **on-field pet count=2** extra boosts, so when 4v2 besides attackers need another pet to stand in, usually formation-specific supports, universal supports, constellation pets, etc. Once stand-in pet dies, damage drops sharply. Can also utilize Abys to pull pets from backpack, converting 6v1 to 4v2, thus providing high damage boost.
:::

:::tip
Abys pulling method: King exclusive required, otherwise too few rounds. Place pet you want to pull in last slot of backpack, Abys enters and gets extra round, click system then switch to attacker. Pulled pets don't inherit self-destruct buffs, so never pull out attackers.
:::

- **Recommended Standard Formations**
- **6v1 (High-end): Empress + Ziya/Fire Tian/Mengpo + Constellation + Abys + Attacker + Stand-in Pet**
- **6v1 (Mid-tier): Empress + Ziya + Dragon King + Black Wing + Constellation + Attacker (Black Wing can be replaced with other damage boost pets)**
- **6v1 (Low-tier): Sun Xinuo + Sacred Spirit Xinuo + Wood Xinuo + Dragon Xinuo + Constellation + Attacker**
- **Note** Most challenges **mid-tier or even low-tier formations** are sufficient, low-tier formation damage is about **75%** of mid-tier. High-tier formation not essential, but can somewhat reduce requirements.
- **4v2: Relatively more formations, will be detailed in Formation Teams chapter.** Need to ensure: **attribute reduction, attribute increase, weakening, restraint multiplier**. Recommend two **early game versatile formations:**
- **Xinuo Team: Sun Xinuo + Fire Xinuo/Ancient Xinuo/Little Xinuo + Sacred Spirit Xinuo + Xinuoma/Moon Xinuo**
- **Evoker Team: Empress + Fire Angel + (Emperor Card/Star Ring Empress + Evoked Holy Tianyi)**
- **Empress + Fire Angel + (Emperor Card/Star Ring Nuwa + Evoked Holy Tianyi)**
- **Note** Xinuo Team applies to most low-stat challenges, while Holy Tianyi/Pangu with extremely high stats can clear most challenges, even without克制. Star Ring Master can start with Otherworld in early game.

Additionally, pay attention to **out-of-battle boosts**:

- **Summoner Skills**: Dual Blade damage +50% separate damage multiplier
- **Pet Imprints**: Restraint damage +80%
- **Light Initiation Compendium**: Light Initiation pet damage +9%
- **Team Tian Gong Tree**: BOSS Killer damage +5%; Chosen One crit damage +10%
- **Trainer**: Final damage +6%
- **God Weapon Pets**: After binding provides stat values, damage boost/crit damage boost.
- **Special Blessings**: Summer, winter and other important periods, generally include boss HP reduction, etc.
