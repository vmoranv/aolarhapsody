Only represents personal experience, if watching clearing guides suggest following the up.

### Pet Recommendations

- **Early game recommendations** that greatly help clearing and have high challenge difficulty. For example **Third Gen Dream, Heavenly Maiden** etc. Black Plum and other commonly used Light Ember and Hero pets are used a lot for clearing, but **challenges are very simple**, not recommended to waste opportunities.
- **Mid-late game recommendations**
  - (1) Pets that can only be bought with Ao Coins/Starry Coins normally, for completing pokedex, such as Zeus, Second Gen Zhuo Jun, Third Gen Monkey etc.
  - (2) Supreme Glory replicants. If you have all these, just pick pets you like.
  - Random pets generally have large range, mixed quality, **therefore not recommended to spend a lot of Starry Coins on random**, if really necessary get a God Weapon replicant or missing Starry.
  - **Summon Array Exchange** prioritize exchanging commonly used attackers, can complete challenges later.
  - **Based on early game usage frequency, Starry recommendation priority acquisition:**
  - Ember Roland (Super King), Yin (Universe), Xue Wuhunling (Super Holy Spirit), Lingfeng (Super Electric), Longyin Guard (Super Dragon), Quehuang (Super Dark), Little Bear (Super Mystic), Dika (Super Light), Mingwang (Super Earth).

### Cultivation Recommendations

::: warning
Do not create demand, cultivate new not old.
:::

- **T0**: **Key commonly used universal assists** e.g.: Empress and Burning Angel that sometimes need to stand in field, don't upgrade talent soul cards and ask why they die easily. Heavenly Empress, Zi Ya, Dragon King also need to cultivate to 48000 battle effectiveness full skills. Soul cards can be dismantled later without affecting, just bring an Awareness Card.
- **T1**: **Commonly used team main C**, **Light Ember commonly used attackers** if not cultivating output, who are you saving resources for?
- **T2**: Commonly used Starry pets and God Weapon pets, cultivate when used.
  :::danger
  Most other pets don't need to be cultivated, including team standing assists.

### Soul Card Soul Weapon Recommendations

- **Paid Cards**: 2 Dust 1 Decay 1 Response, then Wall, if you have all can get a Secret, Ring. Music, Flower and Source also ok. If you have all, can consider monthly paid cards, ask big shots before buying.
- **Soul Weapons**: Prioritize modules, book and flower circles two each. First do all novice task obtainable, if you have all these, special effect soul weapons priority: Chain > Bird Cage > Sage's Counterattack > Others.
- **Realm Soul Weapons Recommendation**: Fishing Hook > Streaming Light Slash > Alert Cat Doll > Others
