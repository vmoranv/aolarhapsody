::: tip
You can borrow one from your master, one from a friend, and two from a close friend (summer vacation benefit), for a total of 4 pets, enough for a whole 4v2 team. It is recommended to take advantage of the summer vacation to complete all the 4v2 challenges that allow borrowing pets. If you are not a new/returning player, you cannot borrow pets from friends.
:::

::: info
The soul cards, soul weapons, etc., of pets are updated from time to time, so it is recommended to communicate with experienced players about which pets to borrow. The borrowed constellation pets use your own constellation points. In the early stage, it is recommended to borrow commonly used powerful DPS pets, including Du, Huanling Xingnuoma, Abisi, Mibao 132, Boluo, Xinglong, etc. You can find experienced players in the group to borrow them.
:::

## Appendix 2: Ranking of pets that clear persistent effects and numerical values

This refers to buffs that last for 999 rounds (such as Xingmeng, Longtan, etc.). Buffs with a duration of less than 10 rounds can be cleared by a pet with Sage's Counterattack (such as 132's Eternal Power, Belial's Purgatory, etc.). Guangqi's KK can clear the opponent's buffs with a duration of less than 10 rounds when it enters the field, and the second-generation Caesar can also do so upon death.

### The One True God

1.  **Otherworldly Nuwa**
    - **How to use:** As long as it's not the first pet, it clears all persistent effects on the opponent's side immediately upon switching in. No exclusive equipment is needed, but the passive skill must be maxed out.
    - **How to obtain:** Search for Nuwa's Palace in the scene and purchase for 298 star coins / Otherworldly Blind Box

Clearing persistent effects will also remove debuffs applied by our support pets, so it is recommended to switch her in after the initial constellation pet.

### T0

1.  **Spirit Liu Bei**
    - **How to use:** Use ultimate skill upon entering the field to clear a single target's effects (must hit). No exclusive equipment needed.
    - **How to obtain:** Draw from the Otherworldly Summoning Array during Spirit Week / Otherworldly Blind Box
2.  **Super-dimensional Pangu**
    - **How to use:** Clears opponent's persistent effects when hit or using ultimate skill. Requires exclusive equipment.

### T1

- **Aoyi Angel Yin**
  - **How to use:** Use Super Aoyi at the beginning of the battle. High probability of clearing a single target's effects when hit (beware of constant revival).
  - **How to obtain:** Beg from experienced players, requires 5000 intimacy. No exclusive equipment needed.
- **Otherworldly Cherry**
  - **How to use:** Clears all effects on the field with an attribute skill, no need to hit.
- **Super-dimensional Caesar**
  - **How to use:** Clears all effects on the field with an attribute skill, no need to hit.

### T2:

- **Aoyi Xuanyuan:** Use attribute skill [Xuejian Xuanyuan]. If the opponent uses a skill that can hit you within 3 rounds, their single target effects will be cleared.
- **Shenqi Heikun:** [Xuanxu Liuhe] Clears single target (can miss).
- **Shenhua Wumian:** [Wuming Shuangying] Clears single target at the end of the round (can miss).
- **Legendary Zhanhuo Zhiwang:** Attribute skill [Zhanyi Zhansha] clears single target.
- **Aoyi Hades:** Attribute skill [Linghun Chongzhi] clears single target.
- **Huixiang Gandharva:** Small skill + attribute skill can clear the entire field.

### T3:

- **Legendary Xiukai:** [Shengguang Chengjie] Clears single target (this one is blind and can miss).
- **King Hades:** Accumulate 4 energy to use ultimate skill [Wanming Tianzui] to clear single target.
- **Legendary Pangu:** After activating the domain, [Kaitian Shengfu] clears single target (this skill is a guaranteed hit).
- **Chaos Angel King:** Accumulate 3 stars to use ultimate skill with a chance to clear single target (exclusive equipment provides invincibility for the first round on the field, which is good for survival).
- **Aoyi Emperor Dragon:** If your speed stat is higher than the opponent's, the attribute skill [Shayi Wushuang] clears single target at the end of the round (can be used directly with the summer/winter vacation buff, otherwise use Aoyi to reduce the opponent's speed first, then use the attribute skill).

### T4:

- **Legendary Seraph K:** Accumulate 5 souls to use ultimate skill to clear single target (takes a long time to accumulate).
- **Aoyi Huanxing Langshen:** [Lijiu Tianliu] Low probability to clear single target (this skill is a guaranteed hit, but the probability is very low).

::: tip
Clearing persistent effects clears buffs, which is different from clearing numerical values.

Pets that clear numerical values can only clear the opponent's increased numerical values, including Xingmeng and level buffs.

It is recommended to use Otherworldly [Natural Origin] Shenqi Gaia, which can be obtained from the old event list in My. It can trigger the effect of clearing numerical values upon entering the field, but the passive skill needs to be maxed out. You can also use the attribute skill as the first move. The same applies to Xinghui's Qingyin Miaolü · Gandharva. With exclusive equipment, it can clear numerical values upon entering the field, otherwise, you need to use the attribute skill manually.

If you don't have it, you can also use Otherworldly Super-dimensional pets, whose names are generally [xxxx] Super-dimensional xx. They clear the opponent's increased numerical values at the end of each round.

## Appendix 4: Spirit Adam Cheesing Tutorial

Spirit Adam directly deducts HP, ignoring immunity to fixed damage and immunity to non-super-effective damage, and can cheese 6v1 challenges.

### 1. Adam Mengxiang Jingling Team (High-speed, unstable, most practical)

#### Team Members:

- **Basic version:** Soul Pet, Guangqi Guilingzhe, Mengxiang Jingling, Xiaoyao, Adam
- **Advanced version:** Soul Pet, Guangqi Guilingzhe, Mengxiang Jingling, Xiaoyao, Otherworldly King Xihe, Adam

#### Pet Roles:

- **Soul Pet (Soul Pulling):** Otherworldly soul pets can pull dual souls and absorb the numerical values of two souls. Qingming is the top recommendation, but other soul pets will also work.
- **Guangqi Guilingzhe:** Clears the opponent's light energy upon entering the field, ensuring Xiaoyao can switch out safely; leaves a debuff on the entire enemy team that can be cleared by Mengxiang Jingling, which indirectly increases Mengxiang Jingling's reset probability and turns the reset soul into a 100% HP dead soul, allowing for more numerical value absorption (usable in Otherworld, level 1 is best).
- **Mengxiang Jingling (Dead Soul):** The skill Huiyi Paomo resets the entire field, turning souls into dead souls. Dead souls are PVP units, and some powerful skills that are ineffective against bosses can now be used to their full potential.
- **Xiaoyao (Protection):** Protects Mengxiang Jingling and Adam.
- **Otherworldly King Xihe (Reset):** Because Adam absorbs numerical values, the absorbed soul's numerical values will be lost. Xihe's Shili mark can restore the soul to a high numerical value state, improving Adam's absorption efficiency.
- If you don't have it, you can replace it with the Xinghui annual VIP Yuzhe, using the Guangnian Baoshi to speed up the absorption of numerical values.
- **Spirit Adam (Absorbing Numerical Values):** Absorbs the numerical values of dead souls. Through the large amount of absorbed numerical values, it ignores HP lock each round and absorbs 15% of the enemy Adam's total attributes in HP, achieving cross-era output.

#### Operation Flow:

- **Round 1:** Soul pet enters the field and uses Super Yuanqi · Shou to pull souls.
- **Round 2:** Soul pet switches to Guilingzhe.
- **Round 3:** Guilingzhe switches to Xiaoyao.
- **Round 4:** Xiaoyao switches to Mengxiang Jingling.
- **Round 5:** Mengxiang Jingling uses Huiyi Paomo on the main body until a 100% HP dead soul appears.
- **Round 6:** Mengxiang Jingling uses Huiyi Paomo on the main body until a 100% HP dead soul appears.
  ![](/aola/onemorething_150.png)

Generally, you only have 2-3 chances to use Huiyi Paomo in one battle. If a dead soul doesn't appear after 2-3 uses, just restart.

- **Round 7:** After a dead soul appears, switch to Xiaoyao.
- **Round 8:** Switch to Adam (if you have Xihe, switch to Xihe).
- **Round 9:** Use Tianming Weiwo once on the dead soul to absorb HP and improve battlefield performance.
- **Round 10:** Use Jiushi Zhaohuan to absorb numerical values until the soul dies.
- **Round 11:** Use Jiushi Zhaohuan to absorb numerical values until the soul dies.
- **Round 12:** After the soul dies, you can use either Tianming Weiwo or Jiushi Zhaohuan.

::: warning

- Mengxiang Jingling has a chance to be dodged when attacking Otherworldly souls. It is recommended to attack the main body directly. After the skill hits and resets the soul to a dead soul, there is another 20% probability calculation. Applying a debuff that can be cleared can increase the probability.

- Adam's recommended spirit contract is Eve (90% true resistance when HP is >80%). Eve is not mandatory, others will also work if you don't have her. She can be drawn from the Otherworldly Summoning Array during the Juejie week. Mengxiang Jingling needs to be leveled up to 60 to learn the skill Huiyi Paomo.

- Guangqi Guilingzhe can be replaced by other pets that can apply long-duration debuffs to the entire enemy team. If you don't have one, the enemy soul will be reset to a 0 HP soul, which cannot be targeted by skills but can be targeted by code, which is more complicated.

- Do not use Adam's sacrifice skill, as it will reset the absorbed attributes.

- After Adam leaves the field, the absorbed numerical values will be reset, but the absorbed HP limit will be retained.
  :::

### 2. Adam Tongling Wumian Team (Lowest configuration, slow, stable)

#### Team Members:

- **Otherworldly Qingming (Soul Pulling):** Otherworldly Qingming can pull dual souls and absorb the numerical values of two souls. Since it needs to stay on the field, it needs to have 10,000 HP. Starting with Xiaoyao and switching to Qingming can ensure that Qingming does not reflect damage, thus preserving two 1% HP souls. If you use other soul pets, you need to cooperate with Otherworldly Ta Wang to stay on the field (replacing Guilingzhe).
- **Guangqi Guilingzhe:** Clears the opponent's light energy upon entering the field, ensuring Xiaoyao can switch out safely.
- **Tongling Wumian:** Delays the damage received by the target until the end of the round. Upon death, it ensures that Adam does not lose soul HP when entering the field, thus allowing it to absorb the numerical values of two 1% HP souls. Can be obtained from the old event list in My.

#### Adam Configuration Requirements:

- Adam needs the Jianyi inscription and high HP. Lanjie is best, otherwise Xianyu set will do. Also requires some luck.

## Appendix 5: Introduction to 4v2 Large HP Deduction Cheesing

### Team Members and Principle

- **Team Members:** Zhanyi Hai + Yongzhui Xingyu · Xingmo + two Shuangsheng pets
- **Principle:** When a Shuangsheng pet's clone dies, and another Shuangsheng pet creates a clone, an untargetable clone will be stuck. Both the boss and our side will not act, but the rounds will continue. Since the battle round limit is achieved by resetting our pet's HP to 0, the stuck clone cannot be targeted, thus ignoring the level's round limit. This allows Xingmo's infinite-round fixed damage to kill the boss.

### Pet Roles

- **Zhanyi Hai (Protection):** Protects the Shuangsheng pets. Exclusive equipment, strongest protection in 4v2. Can be replaced with Xiaoyao if you don't have it.
- **Xingmo:** Fixed damage. With exclusive equipment, it can be used upon entering the field. Without exclusive equipment, it needs Xiaoyao's protection to release skills and stack poison.
- **Shuangsheng Pet:** Bug exploitation. The top choices are Yuanzui Shuanggou (can create a clone upon entering the field) and Shuangsheng Qiankun (can create a clone upon entering the field), followed by Shuangfeng (can revive). Other Shuangsheng pets are theoretically feasible but not as good as these three.

### Operation Flow Example

#### Preparation Phase

- Relatively flexible, not limited to this order. Assuming the use of Shuanggou and Qiankun.

#### Phase 1: Cloning Phase

- **Round 1:** Shuangsheng pet A creates a clone, Shuangsheng pet B is replaced by Xingmo. If Xingmo is killed, replace with Hai.
- **Round 2:** Shuangsheng pet A uses a small skill, Hai is replaced by Shuangsheng pet B.
- **Round 3:** If Shuangsheng pet A's clone is dead, Shuangsheng pet B creates a clone.

#### Subsequent Phases

- After that, just wait for the other pets to be killed. Sometimes the battle will end when a certain amount of HP is deducted.

::: warning

- Some levels' immunity to non-super-effective buffs will disappear after 999 rounds. You can use large HP deduction.
- Do not have two pets create clones at the same time. Do not use Super Yuanqi He after creating a clone.
- It can also be used in 6v1, but requires Abisi.

    ![](/aola/onemorething_165.png)

### Qingming 10,000 HP Cultivation

If you still haven't reached 10,000 HP in battle after the above cultivation, you can change the summoner skill to Juhua to achieve the goal of 10,000 HP.

### Best Combination

- Suoxue + Caesar + Qingming + Shengyu Gou (4v2) + Xiaoyao + Dalishen (6v1)

#### Recommended Pets:

5.  **Otherworldly Super-dimensional Caesar** (stays on the field for one round to absorb 20% of the enemy's single target's true resistance, doubled if no damage is taken, better with Spirit Yisaer's contract)
6.  **Super Aoyi Chihan Tianfeng** (Super Aoyi applies Nuhuo mark, which explodes and deals fixed damage when it reaches three stacks)
7.  **Yinyang Baigui Zhu Soul Qingming** (Otherworldly, undead, up to 9999 times). Recommended to use Otherworldly Qingming for 6v1, Xinghui is also fine.
8.  **Yinyang Zhu Baigui Wang · Qingming** (Xinghui, undead, up to 9999 times). Recommended to use Xinghui Qingming for 4v2, Otherworldly is also fine.

### 55. Zhouyu Zhongyu - Shanggu Xinglong (Super Ancient Type): Increases attributes each round, ultimate's Lingshun grants Huajie once, small skill clears 2 debuffs. With exclusive equipment, it will also grant Huajie to each pet's first skill, very "birth". Fortunately, it doesn't appear often now, but there is one in Huanxiang Shishi with over ten million HP and exclusive equipment.

- **Handling Method:** Each self-destruct pet uses a small skill to attack once and then self-destructs. You can bring two attribute-reducing pets such as Empress and Mengpo to deal with the rapid increase in attributes. If it appears in 42 in the future, it is recommended to kill it as soon as possible.

::: warning
Most pets with exclusive equipment increase and decrease attributes very quickly, so be sure to lock and protect your attributes.

If you encounter a strange situation, it is recommended to check the skills or level buffs.

## Appendix 10: Introduction to Mibao/Annual VIP Pet PVE

### Foreword

- **Not recommended to buy Mibao for PVE!**
- **Annual VIP Abisi:** Do what you can. Having a puller can reduce the configuration requirements by a lot, and it is also a good super digital attacker.

### Equipment Description

"Obtain all extra effects in multi-pet modes" in the equipment refers to:

- Extra effects in multi-pet modes in the pet's skills
- Extra effects in multi-pet modes in the equipment
- These effects can also be triggered in 4v2

### 1. Quanwei Yanhua zhi Yue - Abisi

- **Type:** Super Digital
- **Role:** Normal attack attacker, can also be a support
- **Features:** A super digital attacker with very high stats

#### System

- **6v1:** Pulls out the last pet in the backpack, making the number of our pets on the field 2.
  - If Abisi is the last pet in the backpack, it will pull out the last pet in the backpack other than Abisi.
  - The pulled-out pet cannot use items on itself, cannot self-destruct, and cannot receive inherited buffs.
  - The probability of being attacked is also generally low. Usually, support pets are pulled out.
- **4v2:** The system is generally not used in PVE.

#### As an Attacker

- **Basic Lineup:** F4 + constellation pet + Abisi is enough for most situations.
- **High Damage Lineup:** Empress + Seraph + constellation pet + Xingchen + Abisi + Ciyuan Shouhu 132 / Second Generation Heiyi
- **Dual DPS Lineup:** When the number of pets on the field = 2, Abisi has its own super-effective multiplier, so it can be one of the dual DPS in 4v2.

#### As a Support

- **Condition:** When the attacker has a pet that increases the super-effective multiplier of the corresponding attribute (usually refers to a system team support).
- **Lineup:** Empress + Ziya/Seraph/Nüdi/Mengpo + Abisi + constellation pet + attacker + corresponding support
  - **Example:** When using Qiling Wang as an attacker, pull Caesar to increase the super-effective multiplier of the super electric type.
- **Alternative:** If you don't have the corresponding support, you can use Alai / Ciyuan Shouhu 132 / Second Generation Heiyi / Qiyuan Xihe (new skill set).
- **Alternative Plan:** You can also pull out the constellation pet directly. The most important thing is to get the bonus from having 2 pets on the field.

### 2. Zhouyu Zhonglü - Shanggu Xinglong

- **Type:** Super Ancient / Reverse Ancient
- **Role:** Special attack attacker
- **Features:**
  - Can transform into Reverse Ancient, can carry super ancient type skills, has a very wide super-effective coverage.
  - High PVE bonus, many hits, high damage.
  - One of the top attackers, shines in the special attack island of Kevin Island.

#### System

- **6v1:** Pulls out the next pet in the backpack (requires a living pet in the backpack to sacrifice).
- **4v2:** Sacrifices a teammate to summon the Star God's Body.
  - All-attribute stats become 150%.
  - Inherits buffs with a duration of less than 10 rounds from the teammate.
  - Cannot be switched, and is considered as 2 pets on the field.
  - The exclusive equipment of the Reverse Ancient attribute has a 200% critical hit rate.

#### Recommended Lineup

- **6v1 Lineup:** Generally, F4 + constellation pet + Xinglong is enough, no need for Abisi to pull. Just transform and attack.
- **4v2 Lineup:** It is recommended to use Empress + Nüdi + Xinglong + Loran.
  - Since Xinglong inherits buffs with a duration of less than 10 rounds from its teammate, both Empress and Nüdi can self-destruct in the first round.
  - Loran activates the constellation and uses its ultimate.
  - Xinglong waits until the 3rd round when the constellation duration is 9 to activate the system and sacrifice.
  - Xinglong has high critical damage, so Nüdi is recommended.
  - Loran's ultimate has a Ranshao buff that can be inherited by Xinglong.

**Note:** Loran should not have the +5 duration constellation, and Nüdi should not have the Daohouzhe, as it will replace the buff of the same name.

Loran can also be replaced with the super ancient type constellation pet Yu Xingli. In this case, Nüdi stays on the field normally, Empress self-destructs and is replaced by the constellation pet, which is then switched to Xinglong. You can also have the +5 duration constellation.

### 3. Qizui Shengcai - Yisaer: Super Dragon Type, Normal Attack Attacker

- Ultimate restores light energy, attacks 7 times, has a high PVE bonus, and has its own super-effective multiplier when the number of pets on the field = 2. The strongest super dragon type attacker, and also one of the top attackers of all types. The system sacrifices itself in 6v1, but the summoned pet has low hits, so it is generally not used in PVE (even with Abisi pulling, it still sacrifices itself). In PVE, you generally don't need to care about the three contract underlings, the attributes they provide have little impact on PVE.

#### Recommended Lineup

- **6v1 Lineup:** Generally, F4 + constellation pet + Yisaer is enough. For higher damage, you can bring Xingchen/Abisi.
- **4v2 Lineup:** Empress + Seraph + constellation pet + Yisaer is enough. Since it has its own super-effective multiplier when the number of pets on the field = 2, it can form a dual DPS lineup with other DPS. Since the ultimate attacks 7 times, it can be paired with Dijeishi Kaos.

### 4. Yongheng Chiyang - Shen Apolo: Super Holy Spirit Type, Special Attack Attacker

- High defense penetration and 22 bonus, all skills will combo with the exclusive equipment once. The strongest super holy spirit type attacker.

- **System:** In PVE, you can choose not to upgrade to Otherworldly, and you don't need to use the system. Just use the exclusive skill and ultimate, and use the ultimate whenever it's available. If you bring Xingchen (optional), you can click Shenxu three times and then use Shen · Riyao Tianqiong. In 4v2, you can use the small skill first, and use Shenxu to accumulate one Shen · Riyao Tianqiong, because it is a skill that hits the entire field.

- **6v1 Lineup:** Generally, F4 + constellation pet + Boluo is enough. For higher damage, you can bring Abisi.
- **4v2 Lineup:** Empress + Nüdi/Mengpo + constellation pet + Boluo is enough.

### 5. Zhizhang Wanshi Lunhui Yinguo - Dijun: Super God Type, Special Attack Attacker

- Has a PVE bonus but no 22 bonus. Does not require Abisi, but the damage is not as good as Shen Xihe with Abisi pulling. Use the new skill set, otherwise there is no PVE bonus. Requires Xingchen because the ultimate's damage is relatively high.

#### Recommended Lineup

- **6v1 Lineup:** Empress + Ziya + Longwang + constellation pet + Xingchen + Dijun
- **4v2 Lineup:** I feel it's not as good as Shen Xihe.

### 6. Qunxing Shouhu Huanyu Guanghui - Shen Yinhe: Annihilation Type, Normal Attack Attacker

- Has a PVE bonus but no 22 bonus. The strongest annihilation type attacker, but the annihilation type's super-effective coverage is average. If you want to play it, you can. The annihilation type constellation pet should be coming soon. It can inflate its own stats to 200%. The damage mainly comes from the ultimate, so Xingchen is a must. The system predicts the opponent's actions. If the prediction is successful, the skill will be enhanced and additional light energy will be gained. In PVE, you can predict that the opponent will attack you every time.

- **6v1 Lineup:** Empress + Ziya + Longwang + constellation pet + Xingchen + Shen Yinhe, not recommended for 4v2.

### 7. Wu Ji Shenyuan - Lalaiye: Complete Type, Normal Attack Attacker

- Has a PVE bonus but no 22 bonus. The PVE bonus is not much, mainly on the ultimate. The damage is not as good as the fifth generation He and Zhenli zhi Hou, and there is no constellation pet. If you want to play it, you must bring Xingchen, activate the true god form, and keep using the ultimate.

- **6v1 Lineup:** Empress + Ziya + Longwang + constellation pet + Xingchen + Shen Yinhe, not recommended for 4v2.

### 8. Wu Ji Yongheng - Abusu: Eternal Type, Normal Attack Attacker. Not recommended for PVE.

### 9. Yijie Shishi - Du: Immortal Type, Special Attack Attacker / Fixed Damage Attacker

- Currently no longer available, you can borrow it from experienced players. It was once very strong in PVE, did not require teammates to stay on the field, and 50% of the fixed damage dealt would splash to the target's teammates. The high fixed damage dealt to the entire field each round could beat most stages. But now there are many high-stat attackers, and there is Huanling Xingnuoma for non-super-effective targets. In addition, many stages are immune to fixed damage / non-super-effective damage, so it is not as necessary anymore. It is not recommended to get it specifically, unless you really like it or have a lot of money.

- **System:** The core of Du's PVE ability. Du's own life type damage is very low, but the immortal type it transforms into has very high PVE damage. In PVE, it deducts 5% of the maximum HP of all pets (including those in the backpack) each round and converts it into immortal's HP at 50% efficiency (both deduction and conversion are capped at Du's special attack stat). The damage dealt by the ultimate to the entire field can also be converted into immortal's HP. When actively used, it transforms into the immortal form and acts again. The immortal's HP is used to cast skills, and the ultimate has a built-in combo. The hard requirement is that the special attack value in the backpack must be 30,000.

- **Lineup:** In 6v1, it is generally paired with Empress, Ziya, Life type constellation pet, Zhongjie Tu, Hong Xihe, etc. You can have Aibi pull Xinghui Tongling Fantian. In 4v2, use Empress + Nüdi/Longwang + Xinghui Tongling Fantian + Du. Xinghui Tongling Fantian is best with the Wang exclusive, no need for the god weapon, but the contract beast is a must, it doesn't matter who it is. If you don't have it, you can replace it with a life constellation pet.
- **How to use:** Use the system skill - Xukong Jianying - system skill - ultimate - system skill - take medicine cycle. In the immortal form, use Yongsheng Zhujue. For direct damage, bring the Chen card and Liuguang Zhan. For fixed damage, bring the Ming card and Deng.
